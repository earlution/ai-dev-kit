## 🚀 Quick Start / Bootstrap

**Not sure where to start? Choose your path:**

### 🎯 I want to use AI Dev Kit frameworks in my project

**→ Start here:** [`INSTALL_IN_YOUR_PROJECT.md`](INSTALL_IN_YOUR_PROJECT.md)

- **New project?** Install frameworks as dependencies (recommended)
- **Existing project?** Migrate from copy-paste to package management
- **Just exploring?** Browse frameworks and documentation first

**Quick Install (Git Submodule - Recommended for Existing Projects):**
```bash
# 1. Add ai-dev-kit as submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/earlution/ai-dev-kit.git .ai-dev-kit

# 2. Copy frameworks
cp -r .ai-dev-kit/packages/frameworks/workflow\ mgt/* ./
cp -r .ai-dev-kit/packages/frameworks/kanban/* ./

# 3. Run installers (REQUIRED)
python scripts/install_release_workflow.py --mode c
python3 scripts/install_kanban_framework.py --mode fresh
```

**📖 Complete Guide:** See [`INSTALL_IN_YOUR_PROJECT.md`](INSTALL_IN_YOUR_PROJECT.md) for detailed instructions and all installation methods.

## About The Project

**AI Dev Kit** is a comprehensive toolkit designed to support AI-assisted development workflows. It provides modular, reusable frameworks for project management, versioning, workflow automation, and documentation lifecycle management.

### Why AI Dev Kit?

**The Problem:** Managing multiple software projects leads to project drift—each project implements slightly different structures, workflows, and conventions. This causes you to reinvent the wheel, repeat the same remedial work, and maintain inconsistent solutions across projects.

**The Solution:** AI Dev Kit serves as the **source of truth** for software project infrastructure. Projects focus on their domain-specific code, while all infrastructure, planning, workflows, and documentation patterns come from shared, evolving frameworks.

**The Vision:** Stop reinventing the wheel. Eliminate drift. Focus on building. Let AI Dev Kit handle the infrastructure.

📖 **[Read the full Vision and Purpose document →](docs/documentation/ai-dev-kit-vision-and-purpose.md)**

### Design Principles

The toolkit is designed to be:
- **Modular:** Use only what you need, combine frameworks as required
- **Portable:** Frameworks can be installed as dependencies or copy-pasted
- **Auto-updating:** Framework dependencies can receive automatic updates
- **Agent-friendly:** Designed for AI-assisted development workflows
