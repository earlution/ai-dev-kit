# E2:S05:T02 – Epic-Level PIR Workflow Design

**Epic:** Epic 2 (Workflow Management Framework)  
**Story:** Story 5 (Post-Implementation Review Workflow)  
**Task:** Task 2 (Design Epic-level PIR workflow)  
**Version:** v0.2.5.2+0

---

## Overview

This document designs the Epic-level Post-Implementation Review (PIR) workflow, providing comprehensive review of completed Epics including all Stories, goals assessment, technical evaluation, lessons learned capture, and knowledge preservation. The design follows established patterns from Release Workflow (RW) and integrates seamlessly with Kanban, versioning, and knowledge base systems.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Review all aspects of Epic completion including Stories, goals, technical decisions, and outcomes
2. **Knowledge Preservation:** Capture lessons learned, patterns, and anti-patterns for future reference
3. **Actionable Outcomes:** Generate follow-up tasks and recommendations from review findings
4. **Integration First:** Seamlessly integrate with Kanban, versioning, RW, and knowledge base
5. **Structured Approach:** Follow consistent phases and steps for reliable, repeatable reviews
6. **Agent-Driven Execution:** Use ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern

## Integration Points

### Release Workflow (RW) Integration

**Trigger:** RW Step 15 (or appropriate step) checks for Epic COMPLETE status
- Deterministic check: Read Epic status from Kanban document
- If COMPLETE, trigger Epic PIR workflow
- RW continues after PIR trigger (non-blocking)

### Kanban Integration

**Updates:**
- Epic document updated with PIR summary
- Bidirectional links (Epic ↔ PIR)
- Follow-up tasks created in Kanban
- Status tracking

### Versioning Integration

**Linking:**
- PIR report uses project versioning schema
- Links to Epic version range
- References Story and Task versions
- No separate PIR versioning needed

### Knowledge Base Integration

**Storage:**
- PIR reports stored in `KB/Reviews/PIR/Epic-{N}/`
- Indexed for searchability
- Cross-referenced with related PIRs
- Linked to Epic and Stories

---

## Success Criteria
