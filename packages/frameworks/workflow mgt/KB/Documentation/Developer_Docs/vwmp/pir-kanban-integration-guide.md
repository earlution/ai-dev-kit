# PIR-Kanban Integration Guide

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-16
**Related:** Epic 2, Story 5 - Post-Implementation Review Workflow

---

## 📖 Overview

This guide documents the integration between the Post-Implementation Review (PIR) workflow and the Kanban system. It covers how PIR reports are linked to Epic/Story documents, how PIR summaries are added to Kanban documents, and how follow-up tasks are created from PIR findings.

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### 1. PIR Status Tracking

**Purpose:** Track PIR completion status in Kanban documents

**Epic Document:**
```markdown
## Post-Implementation Review

**PIR Status:** Complete  
**PIR Date:** 2025-12-16  
**PIR Version:** v0.2.11.9+3  
**PIR Report:** [PIR-Epic-2-v0.2.11.9+3.md](../../Reviews/PIR/Epic-2/PIR-Epic-2-v0.2.11.9+3.md)

### Summary
[One paragraph summary of PIR findings]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]
```

**Story Document:**
```markdown
## Post-Implementation Review

**PIR Status:** Complete  
**PIR Date:** 2025-12-16  
**PIR Version:** v0.2.5.11+1  
**PIR Report:** [PIR-Story-5-v0.2.5.11+1.md](../../Reviews/PIR/Story-5/PIR-Story-5-v0.2.5.11+1.md)

### Summary
[One paragraph summary of PIR findings]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
```

### 2. Bidirectional Linking

**Epic/Story Document → PIR Report:**
- Epic/Story document contains link to PIR report
- Link format: `[PIR-Epic-{N}-v{version}.md](../../Reviews/PIR/Epic-{N}/PIR-Epic-{N}-v{version}.md)`
- Link format: `[PIR-Story-{N}-v{version}.md](../../Reviews/PIR/Story-{N}/PIR-Story-{N}-v{version}.md)`

**PIR Report → Epic/Story Document:**
- PIR report contains link back to Epic/Story document
- Link format: `[Epic {N} Documentation](../../PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-{N}/Epic-{N}.md)`
- Link format: `[Story {N} Documentation](../../PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-{N}/Story-{N}-{name}.md)`

### 3. PIR Summary Section

**Location:** Added after main content, before "Related Work" or at end of document

**Structure:**
- PIR Status (Complete/Pending/Skipped)
- PIR Date
- PIR Version (project version)
- PIR Report link
- Executive Summary (one paragraph)
- Key Findings (bullet list)

### 4. Follow-Up Task Creation

**Purpose:** Auto-create Kanban tasks from PIR findings

**Source:** PIR report "Follow-Up Actions" section

**Task Format:**
```markdown
- [ ] **Action 1:** {Description}
  - **Priority:** {High/Medium/Low}
  - **Owner:** {Assigned to}
  - **Related Work:** {Link to related Epic/Story/Task}
  - **PIR Reference:** [PIR Report](../../Reviews/PIR/...)
```

**Task Location:**
- Added to appropriate Epic/Story Task Checklist
- Linked bidirectionally to PIR report
- Assigned priority based on PIR assessment

---

## 📝 Implementation Pattern

### Step 1: Read PIR Report

**For Epic-Level:**
```python
pir_report_path = f"KB/Reviews/PIR/Epic-{epic}/PIR-Epic-{epic}-v{version}.md"
pir_report = read_file(pir_report_path)
```

**For Story-Level:**
```python
pir_report_path = f"KB/Reviews/PIR/Story-{story}/PIR-Story-{story}-v{version}.md"
pir_report = read_file(pir_report_path)
```

### Step 2: Extract PIR Summary

**Extract from PIR Report:**
- Executive Summary section
- Key Findings section
- Follow-Up Actions section

### Step 3: Update Epic/Story Document

**Add PIR Summary Section:**
```python
pir_section = f"""
## Post-Implementation Review

**PIR Status:** Complete  
**PIR Date:** {review_date}  
**PIR Version:** {version}  
**PIR Report:** [PIR-Epic-{epic}-v{version}.md](../../Reviews/PIR/Epic-{epic}/PIR-Epic-{epic}-v{version}.md)

### Summary
{executive_summary}

### Key Findings
{key_findings}
"""
```

**Insert into Epic/Story Document:**
- Find insertion point (after main content, before "Related Work")
- Insert PIR summary section
- Preserve document structure

### Step 4: Create Bidirectional Links

**Update Epic/Story Document:**
- Add link to PIR report (already in PIR summary section)

**Update PIR Report:**
- Add "Related Work" section if missing
- Add link to Epic/Story document
- Add links to related Stories/Tasks

### Step 5: Create Follow-Up Tasks

**Extract Follow-Up Actions:**
```python
follow_up_actions = extract_follow_up_actions(pir_report)
```

**For Each Action:**
- Create Kanban task document or add to Task Checklist
- Assign priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Link to PIR report
- Link to related work items

---

## 🔧 Script Implementation

### PIR Kanban Update Script

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/update_pir_kanban.py`

**Purpose:** Update Kanban documents with PIR information

**Usage:**
```bash
python packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/update_pir_kanban.py \
  --epic {epic} \
  --story {story} \
  --version {version} \
  --pir-report {path} \
  [--dry-run]
```

**Functions:**
- `update_epic_with_pir()` - Update Epic document with PIR summary
- `update_story_with_pir()` - Update Story document with PIR summary
- `create_follow_up_tasks()` - Create Kanban tasks from PIR findings
- `link_pir_bidirectionally()` - Establish bidirectional links
