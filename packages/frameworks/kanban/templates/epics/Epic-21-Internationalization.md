## Overview

This epic encompasses internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) activities, including language selection at setup, translation infrastructure, translation management, and cultural adaptation. This epic provides the organizational structure for making the framework accessible to users worldwide, supporting multiple languages and cultural preferences.

**Purpose:** Multi-language support and localization.  
**Scope:** Translation, locale management, cultural adaptation, RTL support, language selection at setup.  
**Status:** Project-specific (canonical pattern)

---

## Goals

1. **Language Selection at Setup:** Add language selection prompt (UK/US English MVP)
2. **Set Up i18n Infrastructure:** Establish i18n infrastructure for broader language support
3. **Implement Translations:** Create translations and localization for major languages
4. **Cultural Adaptation:** Adapt content and features for different cultures

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.21.0.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Add language selection prompt at the very beginning of setup processes, starting with UK and US English variants.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E21:S00:T01 – Add language selection prompt to template setup (GitHub template)

- [ ] E21:S00:T05 – Implement configuration persistence (`ai-dev-kit-config.yaml`)
- [ ] E21:S00:T06 – Update content generation to use language preference (RW, templates)
- [ ] E21:S00:T07 – Test UK/US English selection and content generation

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E21:S00:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.21.0.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Language selection prompt added to all setup processes
- UK/US English content variants created
- Configuration persistence implemented
- Content generation uses language preference
- UK/US English selection tested

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- None
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Safe (can be done independently)

- Cultural adaptation

**Blocked By:**
- None (project-specific epic)

**Coordinates With:**
- Epic 12: Frontend and User Interface (RTL support, UI adaptation)
- All feature epics (i18n/l10n requirements)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Translation quality issues — **Mitigation:** Use professional translators, implement review process, test translations
- **Risk:** Cultural adaptation complexity — **Mitigation:** Research cultural requirements, consult cultural experts, test adaptations
- **Risk:** RTL support complexity — **Mitigation:** Use RTL-aware frameworks, test thoroughly, follow RTL best practices

---

## References

- Internationalization best practices
- Translation management standards
- Cultural adaptation guidelines
- RTL support patterns

---

## Contextualization Notes

**Placeholders to Replace:**
- None (project-specific epic, customize based on project needs)

**Customization Guidance:**
- Adjust language selection based on project requirements
- Modify translation approach based on project needs
- Customize cultural adaptation based on target locales
- Integrate with project-specific i18n/l10n tools

---

## Integration Points

- **Epic 12 (Frontend & UI):** RTL support and UI adaptation
- **All Feature Epics:** i18n/l10n requirements for all features
