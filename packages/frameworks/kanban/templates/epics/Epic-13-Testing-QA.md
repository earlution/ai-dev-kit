## Stories

### Story 1: Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.13.1.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Set up testing framework and infrastructure.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E13:S01:T01 – Choose and set up testing framework
- [ ] E13:S01:T02 – Configure test runners
- [ ] E13:S01:T03 – Set up test data management
- [ ] E13:S01:T04 – Create test utilities and helpers
- [ ] E13:S01:T05 – Configure test coverage reporting

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E13:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.13.1.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Testing framework chosen and set up
- Test runners configured
- Test data management set up
- Test utilities and helpers created
- Test coverage reporting configured

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- None
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Safe (can be done independently)

### Story 2: Test Implementation

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.13.2.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Write comprehensive test suites.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E13:S02:T01 – Write unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] E13:S02:T02 – Write integration tests
- [ ] E13:S02:T03 – Write end-to-end tests
- [ ] E13:S02:T04 – Add test fixtures and mocks
- [ ] E13:S02:T05 – Implement test data factories

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E13:S02:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.13.2.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Unit tests written for core functionality
- Integration tests written
- End-to-end tests written
- Test fixtures and mocks added
- Test data factories implemented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story 1 (Testing Infrastructure Setup)
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Blocked (requires Story 1 infrastructure)

### Story 3: Test Automation and CI/CD Integration

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.13.3.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Automate testing and integrate with CI/CD.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E13:S03:T01 – Set up automated test execution
- [ ] E13:S03:T02 – Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] E13:S03:T03 – Add test reporting and notifications
- [ ] E13:S03:T04 – Set up test coverage thresholds
- [ ] E13:S03:T05 – Document testing process

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E13:S03:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.13.3.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automated test execution set up
- Tests integrated with CI/CD pipeline
- Test reporting and notifications added
- Test coverage thresholds set up
- Testing process documented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story 2 (Test Implementation)
- Coordinates with Epic 14 (Deployment & DevOps) for CI/CD integration
- Coordinates with Epic 23 (Process Automation & CI/CD) for CI/CD pipeline
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Blocked (requires Story 2 tests)

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- Quality assurance for all features
- Test coverage requirements

**Blocked By:**
- None (project-specific epic)

**Coordinates With:**
- Epic 10: Data Management and Database (database testing)
- Epic 11: API and Backend Services (API testing)
- Epic 12: Frontend and User Interface (UI testing)
- Epic 14: Deployment and DevOps (CI/CD integration)
- Epic 23: Process Automation and CI/CD (CI/CD pipeline)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Test maintenance overhead — **Mitigation:** Write maintainable tests, use test factories, keep tests simple
- **Risk:** Test flakiness — **Mitigation:** Use proper test isolation, avoid timing dependencies, implement retry logic
- **Risk:** Low test coverage — **Mitigation:** Set coverage thresholds, integrate into CI/CD, track coverage metrics

---

## References

- Testing best practices
- Test automation frameworks
- CI/CD integration patterns
- Test coverage standards

---

## Contextualization Notes

**Placeholders to Replace:**
- None (project-specific epic, customize based on project needs)

**Customization Guidance:**
- Adjust testing framework based on project technology stack
- Modify test types based on project needs (unit, integration, E2E, etc.)
- Customize CI/CD integration based on project infrastructure
- Integrate with project-specific testing tools

## Integration Points

- **Epic 10 (Data Management):** Database testing and test data management
- **Epic 11 (API & Backend):** API testing and integration tests
- **Epic 12 (Frontend & UI):** UI testing and E2E tests
- **Epic 14 (Deployment):** CI/CD integration
