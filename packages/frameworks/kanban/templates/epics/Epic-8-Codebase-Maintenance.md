## Overview

This epic encompasses codebase maintenance and review activities, including addressing IDE-flagged issues (errors, warnings, info), code quality standards, maintenance workflows, and continuous codebase health monitoring. This epic provides the organizational structure for ongoing maintenance work that keeps the codebase healthy and maintainable.

**Purpose:** Codebase maintenance, quality assurance, and continuous improvement.  
**Scope:** Code review processes, maintenance tasks, quality standards, IDE-flagged issues, and codebase health monitoring.  
**Status:** Core Framework Epic (universal need)

---

## Goals

1. **Address Maintenance Issues:** Systematically address IDE-flagged issues and ongoing maintenance tasks
2. **Establish Code Review Standards:** Define and enforce code review standards and processes
3. **Monitor Code Quality:** Track and improve code quality metrics

- [ ] E08:S01:T03 – Define maintenance priorities
- [ ] E08:S01:T04 – Document maintenance process

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E08:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.8.1.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- IDE issue tracking set up
- Maintenance task workflow created
- Maintenance priorities defined
- Maintenance process documented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- None
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Safe (can be done independently)

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- All feature epics (code quality affects all development)

**Blocked By:**
- None (core framework epic)

**Coordinates With:**
- Epic 1: {PROJECT_NAME} Core (core infrastructure integration)
- Epic 22: Architecture Refactoring and Code Quality (refactoring coordination)
- Epic 23: Process Automation and CI/CD (CI/CD quality integration)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Maintenance backlog accumulation — **Mitigation:** Establish regular maintenance cycles, prioritize high-impact issues
- **Risk:** Code review process overhead — **Mitigation:** Automate review checks, focus on high-value reviews
- **Risk:** Quality metrics not actionable — **Mitigation:** Focus on actionable metrics, integrate with development workflow

---

## References

- Code review best practices
- Code quality metrics standards
- Maintenance workflow patterns

---

## Contextualization Notes

**Placeholders to Replace:**
- None (core framework epic, no project-specific placeholders)

**Customization Guidance:**
- Adjust maintenance priorities based on project needs
- Modify code review standards to match project requirements
- Customize quality metrics to match project technology stack
- Integrate with project-specific tooling and processes

---

## Integration Points

- **Epic 1 (Project Core):** Maintenance uses core infrastructure
- **Epic 22 (Architecture Refactoring):** Maintenance coordinates with refactoring work
- **Epic 23 (CI/CD):** Maintenance integrates with CI/CD quality checks
