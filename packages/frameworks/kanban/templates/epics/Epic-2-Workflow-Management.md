# Epic 2: Workflow Management Framework

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Created:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.2.0.0+0 – Template created)  
**Branch:** `epic/2-workflow-management`  
**Version Schema:** `0.2.S.T+B`  
**Production URL:** [Optional]

## Story Checklist

- [ ] **E02:S01 – Workflow Definitions and Patterns** - TODO
- [ ] **E02:S02 – Workflow Automation** - TODO

> **CRITICAL:** This Story Checklist is the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for story status and version markers.  
> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.2.1.3+1)`)  
> **Release Workflow Requirement:** When Release Workflow (RW) Step 4 updates this Epic document, it MUST update **ALL sections**:
> - Epic header `Last updated` field
> - Story Checklist (status and version markers)
> - Detailed story sections (Status, Last updated, task checkboxes)
> - Any other references to the story/task being released
> 
> **Consistency Check:** After each RW, verify that Epic header, Story Checklist, and detailed sections all match.

## Overview

This epic encompasses workflow management and automation framework, including workflow definitions, execution patterns, automation, and workflow-related tooling.

**Purpose:** Workflow management and automation framework.  
**Scope:** Workflow definitions, execution patterns, automation, and workflow-related tooling.  
**Status:** Canonical (part of framework structure)

---

## Goals

1. **Define Workflow Patterns:** Document and standardize workflow patterns for the project
2. **Automate Workflows:** Implement automation for common workflows and processes

---

## Stories

### Story 1: Workflow Definitions and Patterns

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.2.1.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Define and document workflow patterns for the project.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E02:S01:T01 – Document existing workflow patterns
- [ ] E02:S01:T02 – Define standard workflow templates
- [ ] E02:S01:T03 – Create workflow execution guidelines
- [ ] E02:S01:T04 – Document workflow integration points

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E02:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.2.1.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Workflow patterns documented
- Standard workflow templates defined
- Workflow execution guidelines created
- Workflow integration points documented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- None
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Safe (can be done independently)

### Story 2: Workflow Automation

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.2.2.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Automate common workflows and processes.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E02:S02:T01 – Identify automatable workflows
- [ ] E02:S02:T02 – Implement workflow automation scripts
- [ ] E02:S02:T03 – Create workflow execution tools
- [ ] E02:S02:T04 – Document automation usage

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E02:S02:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.2.2.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automatable workflows identified
- Workflow automation scripts implemented
- Workflow execution tools created
- Automation usage documented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story 1 (Workflow Definitions and Patterns)
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Blocked (requires Story 1 definitions)

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- Epic 3: Versioning Framework (workflow integration with versioning)
- Epic 4: Kanban Framework (workflow integration with Kanban)
- Epic 23: Process Automation and CI/CD (workflow automation foundation)

**Blocked By:**
- None (framework epic)

**Coordinates With:**
- Epic 1: {PROJECT_NAME} Core (core infrastructure integration)
- Epic 3: Versioning Framework (versioning workflow integration)
- Epic 4: Kanban Framework (Kanban workflow integration)
- Epic 23: Process Automation and CI/CD (automation coordination)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Over-automation without clear value — **Mitigation:** Identify high-value workflows first, validate automation ROI
- **Risk:** Workflow patterns too rigid — **Mitigation:** Design flexible patterns, allow customization
- **Risk:** Workflow tooling complexity — **Mitigation:** Start simple, iterate based on actual needs

---

## References

- Workflow management best practices
- Automation frameworks and tools
- Process documentation standards

---

## Contextualization Notes

**Placeholders to Replace:**
- None (framework epic, no project-specific placeholders)

**Customization Guidance:**
- Adjust workflow patterns based on project needs
- Add project-specific workflow stories as needed
- Modify automation scripts to match project technology stack
- Integrate with project-specific tools and systems

---

## Integration Points

- **Epic 1 (Project Core):** Workflow execution uses core infrastructure
- **Epic 3 (Versioning):** Workflows integrate with versioning system
- **Epic 4 (Kanban):** Workflows integrate with Kanban framework
- **Epic 23 (CI/CD):** Workflow automation coordinates with CI/CD pipelines
