**Purpose:** Core foundational work for the {PROJECT_NAME} project.  
**Scope:** Fundamental infrastructure, core functionality, foundational frameworks, project setup.  
**Status:** Canonical (part of framework structure)

---

## Goals

1. **Establish Project Foundation:** Set up project structure, version control, development environment, and initial documentation
2. **Build Core Infrastructure:** Implement core architecture patterns, configuration management, logging, and shared utilities
3. **Deliver Initial Features:** Implement minimum viable product (MVP) features and core domain models

## Stories

### Story 1: Project Foundation and Setup

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.1.1.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Establish project foundation, structure, and initial configuration.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E01:S01:T01 – Define project structure and directory layout
- [ ] E01:S01:T02 – Set up version control and repository configuration
- [ ] E01:S01:T03 – Configure development environment and tooling
- [ ] E01:S01:T04 – Create initial project documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE)
- [ ] E01:S01:T05 – Set up build system and dependency management
- [ ] E01:S01:T06 – Configure code quality tools (linters, formatters)
- [ ] E01:S01:T07 – Establish coding standards and conventions

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E01:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.1.1.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Project structure defined and documented
- Version control configured and operational
- Development environment set up and documented
- Initial documentation created
- Build system functional
- Code quality tools configured
- Coding standards documented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- None
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Safe (foundational work, can be done independently)

### Story 2: Core Infrastructure

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.1.2.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Build core infrastructure components that support the entire project.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E01:S02:T01 – Design and implement core architecture patterns
- [ ] E01:S02:T02 – Set up configuration management system
- [ ] E01:S02:T03 – Implement logging and error handling infrastructure
- [ ] E01:S02:T04 – Create utility functions and shared libraries
- [ ] E01:S02:T05 – Set up dependency injection or service container
- [ ] E01:S02:T06 – Implement base classes and interfaces

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E01:S02:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.1.2.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Core architecture patterns documented and implemented
- Configuration management system operational
- Logging and error handling infrastructure functional
- Utility functions and shared libraries created
- Dependency injection/service container set up
- Base classes and interfaces implemented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story 1 (Project Foundation and Setup)
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Blocked (requires Story 1 foundation)

### Story 3: Initial Feature Set

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.1.3.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Implement initial core features that demonstrate project viability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- MVP features implemented and functional
- Core domain models and entities created
- Basic business logic implemented
- Initial data structures set up
- Proof-of-concept implementations validated

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- All other project epics (foundational epic)

**Blocked By:**
- None (foundational epic)

**Coordinates With:**
- Epic 2: Workflow Management Framework (workflow integration)
- Epic 3: Versioning Framework (versioning integration)
- Epic 4: Kanban Framework (project management integration)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Incomplete foundation blocks all other work — **Mitigation:** Prioritize Story 1 and Story 2, ensure core infrastructure is solid before moving to features
- **Risk:** Over-engineering initial setup — **Mitigation:** Focus on MVP foundation, iterate based on actual needs
- **Risk:** Missing critical infrastructure components — **Mitigation:** Review similar projects, consult architecture patterns, validate with stakeholders

---

## References

- Project requirements and specifications
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Similar project implementations
- Framework documentation (if using frameworks)

---

## Contextualization Notes

**Placeholders to Replace:**
- `{PROJECT_NAME}` - Replace with actual project name (e.g., "Confidentia", "fynd.deals")
- `{project-slug}` - Replace with project slug (e.g., "confidentia", "fynd-deals")
- `{DOMAIN}` - Replace with project domain (e.g., "healthcare", "e-commerce")

**Customization Guidance:**
- Adjust stories and tasks based on project size and complexity
- Add project-specific stories as needed
- Modify tasks to match project technology stack and requirements
- Integrate with project-specific frameworks and tools
