## Overview

This epic encompasses Bug Report implementation and management, including Bug Report intake, processing, bug fix workflows, and BR-related tooling.

**Purpose:** Bug Report implementation and management.  
**Scope:** Bug Report intake, processing, bug fix workflows, and BR-related tooling.  
**Status:** Canonical (part of framework structure)

---

## Goals

1. **Establish BR Intake Workflow:** Create systematic workflow for converting BRs to tasks
2. **Provide BR Prioritization:** Develop frameworks for prioritizing and assigning BRs
3. **Define BR Fix Patterns:** Establish consistent patterns for fixing bugs

---

## Stories

### Story 1: BR Intake and Triage Workflow

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.6.1.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Establish systematic workflow for converting BRs to tasks.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E06:S01:T01 – Design BR intake and triage workflow
- [ ] E06:S01:T02 – Create BR triage automation
- [ ] E06:S01:T03 – Integrate BR intake with Kanban
- [ ] E06:S01:T04 – Document BR intake and triage process

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E06:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.6.1.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- BR intake and triage workflow designed and documented
- BR triage automation implemented
- BR intake integrated with Kanban
- BR intake and triage process documented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Depends on Epic 4 Story 2 (FR/BR Intake Process)
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Blocked (requires Epic 4 intake foundation)

### Story 2: BR Prioritization and Assignment

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.6.2.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Provide frameworks for prioritizing and assigning BRs.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E06:S02:T01 – Design BR prioritization framework
- [ ] E06:S02:T02 – Create BR assignment templates
- [ ] E06:S02:T03 – Integrate prioritization with Kanban board
- [ ] E06:S02:T04 – Document prioritization and assignment process

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E06:S02:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.6.2.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- BR prioritization framework designed and documented
- BR assignment templates created
- Prioritization integrated with Kanban board
- Prioritization and assignment process documented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story 1 (BR Intake and Triage Workflow)
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Blocked (requires Story 1 intake workflow)

### Story 3: BR Fix Patterns

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.6.3.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Define consistent patterns for fixing bugs.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E06:S03:T01 – Document bug fix patterns
- [ ] E06:S03:T02 – Create bug fix templates
- [ ] E06:S03:T03 – Define testing requirements for bug fixes
- [ ] E06:S03:T04 – Document bug fix completion criteria

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E06:S03:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.6.3.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Bug fix patterns documented
- Bug fix templates created
- Testing requirements for bug fixes defined
- Bug fix completion criteria documented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story 2 (BR Prioritization and Assignment)
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Blocked (requires Story 2 prioritization)

> Full story: `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-6/Story-003-br-fix-patterns.md`

---

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- All bug fix work (BR processing foundation)

**Blocked By:**
- Epic 4 Story 2: FR/BR Intake Process (intake foundation)

**Coordinates With:**
- Epic 4: Kanban Framework (BR intake coordination)
- Epic 5: FR Implementation (BR/FR coordination)
- All feature epics (bug fixes)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** BR intake bottleneck — **Mitigation:** Automate intake and triage workflow, provide clear templates
- **Risk:** Prioritization framework too complex — **Mitigation:** Start simple, iterate based on actual needs
- **Risk:** Bug fix patterns too rigid — **Mitigation:** Design flexible patterns, allow customization

---

## References

- Bug report management best practices
- Bug triage frameworks
- Bug fix pattern standards

---

## Contextualization Notes

**Placeholders to Replace:**
- None (framework epic, no project-specific placeholders)

**Customization Guidance:**
- Adjust BR intake workflow based on project needs
- Modify prioritization framework to match project requirements
- Customize bug fix patterns to match project technology stack
- Integrate with project-specific workflows and processes

---

## Integration Points

- **Epic 4 (Kanban Framework):** BR intake coordinates with Kanban
- **Epic 5 (FR Implementation):** BR/FR coordination
- **All Feature Epics:** Bug fixes across all feature work
