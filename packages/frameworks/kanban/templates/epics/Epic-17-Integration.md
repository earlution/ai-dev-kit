- [ ] E17:S01:T05 – Create integration tests
- [ ] E17:S01:T06 – Document integration usage

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E17:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.17.1.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Required third-party services identified
- Service options researched and evaluated
- Service integration implemented
- Error handling for external services added
- Integration tests created
- Integration usage documented

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**

**Blocked By:**
- None (project-specific epic)

**Coordinates With:**
- Epic 11: API and Backend Services (API integration patterns)
- Epic 12: Frontend and User Interface (payment UI)
- Epic 15: Security (integration security)
- Epic 19: Analytics and Monitoring (analytics integration)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Third-party service failures — **Mitigation:** Implement error handling, retry logic, fallback mechanisms
- **Risk:** Integration security vulnerabilities — **Mitigation:** Follow security best practices, verify signatures, use secure channels
- **Risk:** Payment processing complexity — **Mitigation:** Use proven payment providers, follow PCI compliance, test thoroughly
