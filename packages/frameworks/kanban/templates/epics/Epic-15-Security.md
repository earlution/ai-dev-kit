## Stories

### Story 1: Security Infrastructure

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.15.1.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Implement security infrastructure and measures.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E15:S01:T01 – Conduct security audit
- [ ] E15:S01:T02 – Implement encryption (data at rest/transit)
- [ ] E15:S01:T03 – Set up security headers
- [ ] E15:S01:T04 – Configure HTTPS/SSL
- [ ] E15:S01:T05 – Implement secure session management
- [ ] E15:S01:T06 – Add security middleware

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E15:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.15.1.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Security audit conducted
- Encryption implemented (data at rest/transit)
- Security headers set up
- HTTPS/SSL configured
- Secure session management implemented
- Security middleware added

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Coordinates with Epic 9 (User Management) for authentication security
- Coordinates with Epic 11 (API & Backend) for API security
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Safe (can coordinate with other epics)

### Story 2: Vulnerability Management

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD] (v0.15.2.0+0 – Template created)

**Goal:** Identify and address security vulnerabilities.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E15:S02:T01 – Set up vulnerability scanning
- [ ] E15:S02:T02 – Implement dependency security checks
- [ ] E15:S02:T03 – Create security update process
- [ ] E15:S02:T04 – Document security incident response
- [ ] E15:S02:T05 – Add security testing

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E15:S02:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.15.2.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Vulnerability scanning set up
- Dependency security checks implemented
- Security update process created
- Security incident response documented
- Security testing added

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story 1 (Security Infrastructure)
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Blocked (requires Story 1 security foundation)
