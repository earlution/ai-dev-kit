# Kanban Governance Policy

**Owner:** Product Ops / Project Leadership  
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-31  
**Applies To:** All work streams that adopt this Kanban system (project-agnostic)  
**Source Example:** Confidentia project (original implementation), fynd.deals Epic 15 (operational patterns)

---

## Purpose

A single, authoritative policy describing how to run Kanban with:

- Work-item types (Epic → Story → Task) and how they map to Git artifacts  
- Documentation, numbering, and versioning requirements  
- Rituals (board usage, stand-ups, release workflow) linked to the knowledge base

This document originated in the **Confidentia** project but is written so it can be **ported to any project** by:

- Updating **file paths** to your own KB structure  
- Updating **terminology** (e.g., Epic/Story/Task vs Theme/Epic/Story)  
- Integrating with your own **versioning policy** and **workflow rules**

**Foundation:** In the original project, this policy is underpinned by Cursor rules (`.cursorrules`). For your project, treat `.cursorrules` (or equivalent automation/config) as the **enforcement layer** for this policy.

---

## The Harmonious Cycle

Work flows in perfect harmony:

```
Task (Kanban)
  → defines what to do
    → Version (RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD)
      → tracks the work
        → Release Workflow
          → implements both policies
            → Kanban Update
              → records the version (forensic marker)
                → Repeat
```

**Principle:** All substantive work MUST be task-driven.
If work doesn't map to a task, the Kanban needs updating.

**FR/BR/UXR source of truth:**  
- Every **FR**, **BR**, and **UXR** MUST resolve to **at least one** **Kanban Task** (the **primary implementing** task may be shared across multiple reports if scope is intentionally combined—then every doc MUST cite that task).  
- Tasks must always live **under a Story**, which must always live **under an Epic** (once epics are in use for the project).

**Atomic intake (blocking):** Creating or materially filing an FR/BR/UXR **without** creating/linking its task **in the same working session** is **forbidden**. Agents and humans MUST finish: (1) FR/BR/UXR markdown, (2) task markdown under the chosen story, (3) bidirectional **`Implementing Task:`** / **Associated BR/FR/UXR** links, (4) story checklist row (or explicit note when checklist update is deferred with owner). **RW / RW -k** may follow but MUST NOT be the first time the task appears.

**FR/BR/UXR → Task → Story → Epic flow (canonical rule):**

1. **FR/BR/UXR arrives** (issue tracker, support channel, notes, etc.).
2. **Check for existing Story** that matches the **delivery** scope (semantic fit—not only repository story):
   - If found → create a **new Task document** under that Story when scope is new; or attach to an existing task if the report truly duplicates that work.
3. **If no Story exists** for this area:
   - Create a new Story under the **appropriate Epic**.
   - Then create the **Task document** under that Story.
4. **If no Epic exists** for this problem domain:
   - Create a new, conceptually broad **Epic** to host the new Story.
   - Then create the Story under that Epic.
   - Then create the **Task document** under that Story.
5. **Immediately** wire the FR/BR/UXR header to the task and the task doc back to the FR/BR/UXR.

**CRITICAL:** No FR/BR/UXR should exist without a corresponding **Task document** anchored to a Story (and Epic). This keeps Kanban, versioning, and release workflow aligned.

**Traceability vs story semantics (KG-R6):** Many projects use a **repository story** (e.g. perpetual FR/BR/UXR repo) plus optional **numeric symmetry** (FR-047 → …:T47) for quick audits. That symmetry is **optional**. The **primary** task SHOULD sit under the story that matches **where work actually happens** (e.g. framework fixes under Epic 6, docs portal under Epic 5). Do **not** create a second “shadow” task solely to preserve id symmetry unless policy explicitly requires it—use links and checklist pointers instead.

---

## Board Structure

The Kanban board provides a comprehensive view of all work items organized hierarchically and prioritized for visibility.

### Board Layout

The board serves as the **parent document** to Story documents, similar to how Story documents are parents of Task documents:

- **Board → Story:** The board links to and tracks all Story documents
- **Story → Task:** Story documents link to and track all Task documents
- This creates a clear hierarchy: **Board (parent) → Story (child) → Task (grandchild)**

### MoSCOW Prioritized Task View

**Purpose:** The board includes a **MoSCOW Prioritized In-Progress Tasks** section that shows all in-progress tasks (status: IN PROGRESS or TODO) organized by priority and ordered chronologically.

**MoSCOW Priority Levels:**

1. **Must Have (M) – Critical Tasks**
   - Critical in-progress tasks that must be completed
   - Highest priority items requiring immediate attention
   - Tasks that block other work or are on critical path

2. **Should Have (S) – Important Tasks**
   - Important in-progress tasks that should be completed
   - High-value items that contribute significantly to goals
   - Tasks that are important but not blocking

3. **Could Have (C) – Nice-to-Have Tasks**
   - Nice-to-have in-progress tasks that could be completed
   - Lower priority items that add value but are not essential
   - Tasks that can be deferred if needed

4. **Ongoing (O) – Perpetual Tasks**
   - Ongoing maintenance tasks that never complete
   - Perpetual tasks that are tracked but don't block other work
   - Tasks that require continuous attention (e.g., workflow maintenance, changelog management)
   - These tasks are visible but don't interfere with prioritization of completable work

5. **Won't Have (W) – Deferred Tasks**
   - Tasks that are deferred or not being actively worked on
   - Items explicitly marked as out of scope for current cycle
   - Tasks that may be revisited in future iterations

**Chronological Ordering:**

- For **Should Have (S), Could Have (C), Ongoing (O), and Won't Have (W):** Tasks within each section are ordered **chronologically** (most recently updated first)
- For **Must Have (M):** Use stack/queue ordering as defined in the "Task prioritisation and MUST HAVE ordering" section below
- Ordering is based on the task document's `Last updated` field (for S/C/O/W) or stack/queue rule (for M)

### Task prioritisation and MUST HAVE ordering

**Initial prioritisation:** Every new task must be placed in one MoSCOW category (M, S, C, O, or W). No task is added directly to COMPLETE. Projects may define their own criteria for M vs S vs C (e.g. critical path = M, high value = S, nice-to-have = C); the framework does not prescribe domain-specific rules.

**MUST HAVE ordering:** Within the MUST HAVE (M) section, use two ordering behaviours:

- **Stack (for bug-based or breaking work):** Treat M as a stack. Add new items to the **top** of the MUST HAVE list. Work **top-first** so the most recently added urgent item is done first. Use this for tasks that fix critical bugs or address breaking issues.
- **Queue (for all other MUST HAVE work):** Treat M as a queue. Add new items to the **end** of the MUST HAVE list. Work **front-first** so the first item in the list is done first. Use this for planned feature work and non-urgent M tasks.

**Rule:** For each new MUST HAVE task, classify it as either *bug-based/breaking* (stack) or *other* (queue) and add it to the top or end of the M section accordingly.

**Scripts and processes:** Scripts and processes that update the MoSCOW section (e.g. UKW, Release Workflow) must either respect stack vs queue when inserting or ordering tasks, or document that ordering is manual or agent-defined.

**Definition of COMPLETE:** A task is COMPLETE only when **fully implemented** (work done, code or docs delivered, released in a version) **and** **signed off** (validated, accepted by the responsible party). Tasks move from a MoSCOW column into COMPLETE only when both conditions are met. Do not mark a task COMPLETE solely because a version exists—only when implementation is done and signed off.

**Discoverability:** For "how to prioritise" and queue/stack behaviour, see the Kanban board guide (e.g. `KANBAN_BOARD_GUIDE_TEMPLATE.md` or project-specific `kanban-board-guide.md`).

**Task Entry Format:**

Each task entry in the MoSCOW sections includes:
- **Task ID:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}` format (e.g., `E4:S13:T02`)
- **Task Description:** Brief description of the task
- **Last Updated:** Date when task was last updated
- **Links:** Links to Task document and parent Story document
- **Terminal Timestamp Field (REQUIRED):** Final pipe-delimited field at end of line: `| Last modified: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC`

**Example Format:**
```markdown
- **E4:S13:T02** – Update Kanban governance policy - IN PROGRESS - [Task Doc](epics/Epic-4/Story-013-kanban-board-moscow-prioritized-task-view/T02-update-kanban-governance-policy.md) | [Story](epics/Epic-4/Story-013-kanban-board-moscow-prioritized-task-view.md) | Last modified: 2025-12-18 14:05 UTC
```

**Timestamp governance (mandatory):**
- The terminal `| Last modified: ... UTC` field is required on all active MoSCOW rows in `kboard.md` and `fbuboard.md`.
- RW/UKW/automation that creates or updates rows must append or refresh this field.
- Human-readable timestamp values must use UTC and 24-hour format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC`).
- **Forensic semantics (UXR-009 / FR-092 Wave 6):** Stamps mutate **only when underlying work evidence exists** on the linked record (status change, content delta, version anchor update, AC progression, or new evidence link). No-op board rewrites, sorting, formatting, alias migration, or metadata refresh **must not** mutate `Last modified`. Synthetic stamp churn at write boundary is blocked.
- **Evidence modes (FR-092 Wave 6 implementation):** The row-mutation pipeline in `update_kanban_docs.py` exposes three evidence modes:
  - `work_authoritative`: caller asserts the invocation itself is substantive evidence (e.g. RW Step 7 advancing a task). Missing stamps may be appended; existing stamps are preserved verbatim.
  - `non_substantive`: caller declares this run is board-hygiene (corpus-canonical sweep, alias migration, formatting reconciliation). The pipeline **must not** introduce synthetic stamps; existing stamps are preserved verbatim. This is the **default** for `run_corpus_canonical_sweep`.
  - `gated`: caller supplies a per-row `evidence_provider(row_id, line) -> bool`. Only rows for which the provider asserts a substantive evidence delta receive a stamp.
- **Audit counters (FR-092 Wave 6, surfaced on RW Step 7 four-surface report and on the corpus-sweep report):** `stamps_appended_with_evidence`, `stamps_skipped_no_evidence`, `stamps_preserved_existing`. Mass synthetic stamp anomalies (e.g. `stamps_skipped_no_evidence` very high while reconciliation report shows substantive surface changes) are forensic warning signals and feed the Wave 7 release-readiness gate.

### RW preventive vs UKW corrective separation (FR-092 / FR-091)

The Release Workflow (RW) and the Update Kanban Workflow (UKW) own **distinct, non-overlapping** responsibilities. This separation is architectural, not just operational.

**RW is preventive and release-atomic:**
- RW Step 7 ("Scoped Kanban Reconciliation, Self-Sufficient") owns release-scope kanban consistency end-to-end for the active Epic/Story/Task slice.
- RW must finish release-scope reconciliation autonomously. **No RW correctness criterion may require a subsequent UKW run.**
- Release-scope minimum reconciliation outputs (four-surface contract, deterministic + idempotent + ordered):
  1. Task doc (host + directly affected child tasks).
  2. Source FR/BR/UXR doc(s).
  3. `kboard.md` canonical row(s) for release-scope task(s); active-row hygiene; no duplicate tail tokens.
  4. `fbuboard.md` canonical row(s) for release-scope FBU(s); supersede / gating / closure markers; no duplicate tail tokens.
- RW Step 7 emits a "touched surfaces + why" report sufficient to reconstruct the reconciliation outcome.

**UKW is corrective and drift-oriented:**
- UKW is a **reactive, optional** workflow for cumulative, cross-cutting board hygiene and drift repair across the full corpus.
- UKW is **not a process dependency** for RW completion. RW correctness must hold without ever invoking UKW.
- UKW exists because canonical workflows are imperfect in practice. The desired direction is to continuously reduce drift creation in RW so UKW becomes a smaller corrective safety net.

**No handoff debt:** Deferring release-scope inconsistencies to UKW is prohibited. Out-of-scope drift (rows / FBUs not touched by the release) may be left to UKW and must be explicitly documented as such; in-scope inconsistencies are an RW Step 7 responsibility.

**See:**
- [`.cursorrules` Step 7 — Scoped Kanban Reconciliation](../../../../.cursorrules)
- [`release-workflow-agent-execution.md` Step 7](../../workflow%20mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md)

- [`FR-092` — Canonical RW/UKW kanban consistency program (meta)](../../../../docs/project-management/kanban/fr-br/FR-092-canonical-rw-ukw-kanban-consistency-program.md)

### Story Checklist

After the MoSCOW sections, the board includes a **Story Checklist** section that lists all stories in a compact format (one line per story):

- **Format:** One line per story with status indicator
- **Purpose:** Provides quick overview of all stories and their completion status
- **Forensic Markers:** Includes version markers for completed stories (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.13.1+1)`)

**Example Format:**
```markdown
- [x] **E4:S13 – Kanban Board Enhancement - MoSCOW Prioritized Task View** - IN PROGRESS (v0.4.13.4+3 – T04 COMPLETE: Packaged RW updated)
  - Story: [`Story-013-kanban-board-moscow-prioritized-task-view.md`](Story-013-kanban-board-moscow-prioritized-task-view.md)
  - Tasks: T01 ✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.13.1+1), T04 ✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.13.4+3), T02-T03 TODO, T05-T06 TODO
```

### Traditional Column Structure (Optional)

Projects may also use a traditional column-based board structure with five columns, left to right:

1. **Backlog** – Groomed but unscheduled
2. **Ready** – Fully specified, awaiting prioritisation
3. **In Progress** – Active work with branch
4. **Verify** – Done, awaiting validation
5. **Done** – Released, tagged, validated

**Rules:**
- Move strictly left → right (no skipping)
- WIP limits per swimlane
- Every card links to KB doc and branch/tag

**Note:** The MoSCOW prioritized task view can be used alongside or instead of the traditional column structure, depending on project needs.

---

## Work Items

### Epics

Governing artifact for a feature set or maintenance theme.

- **Location (example patterns):**
  - **Separate directories:** `docs/project-management/epics/overview/Epic XX/Epic-XX.md`  
  - **Consolidated Kanban:** `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-XX.md` (all Kanban docs in one place)
  - Replace with your KB path for epic overview docs.
- **Branch (example convention):** `epic/<number>-<slug>`  
  - Adjust to your branching strategy if different.
- **Version (when using RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD):** `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` (where EPIC = epic number)
- **Template (example):** `docs/project-management/epics/templates/EPIC_TEMPLATE.md` or `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/templates/EPIC_TEMPLATE.md`

**Consolidated Structure Pattern:**
If using a single `kanban/` directory, Epics live at `kanban/epics/Epic-X.md` with Stories under `kanban/epics/Epic-X/stories/`. This keeps all Kanban docs discoverable in one location.

### Stories

Decompose epic scope into releasable slices.

- **Location (example patterns):**
  - **Separate directories:** `docs/project-management/stories/overview/Epic XX/Story-N-Title.md`
  - **Consolidated Kanban:** `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-X/stories/Story-N-Title.md`
- **Numbering (example):** `E<epic>S<story>` (e.g., `E20S7`)
- **Template (example):** `docs/project-management/stories/templates/STORY_TEMPLATE.md` or `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/templates/STORY_TEMPLATE.md`

**Story Directories:** In consolidated structures, Stories live in `Epic-X/stories/` directories, allowing for associated files (diagrams, notes, etc.) alongside the Story document.

#### PERPETUAL State for Repository Stories

**Purpose:** Repository stories (S01) serve as canonical homes for Feature Requests (FRs), Bug Reports (BRs), and User Experience Research reports (UXRs). These stories are PERPETUAL and never complete.

**PERPETUAL State Definition:**

Repository stories are marked with **Status: IN PROGRESS (PERPETUAL)** and have the following characteristics:

- **Never Complete:** Repository stories never transition to COMPLETE status
- **Excluded from Completion Analytics:** Repository stories are excluded from epic completion calculations
- **Omitted from Board Displays:** Repository stories (E5:S01, E6:S01, E7:S01) are omitted from epic checklist displays in board views (UX optimization)
- **Still Tracked Internally:** Repository stories are still tracked in Epic documents' internal Story Checklists
- **Story-Level Abstract Space Versioning:** Repository stories use story-level abstract space versioning (e.g., v0.5.1.0+0 for E5:S01)

**Repository Story Pattern (S01):**

- **Epic 5, Story 1:** "FR Repo" - canonical home for all Feature Requests
- **Epic 6, Story 1:** "BR Repo" - canonical home for all Bug Reports
- **Epic 7, Story 1:** "UXR Repo" - canonical home for all User Experience Research reports

**Note:** S00 is Epic-level abstract space only (no tasks). Repository stories migrated from S00 to S01 as part of repository story abstract space resolution (E9:S01:T08).

**Traceability pattern (conventional, not mandatory):**

- Some **adopter** layouts use **symmetric ids**: e.g. FR-001 ↔ E5:S01:T01, BR-001 ↔ E6:S01:T01, UXR-001 ↔ repository slot in Epic 7 (`Story-000` / `S00` or `S01` per epic charter).
- **ai-dev-kit:** Epic 7 UXR **repository** pattern is documented in **`E7:S00`** (see project Story-000); Epic 5 FR repo commonly uses **E5:S01:Tnn** aligned with FR number—**convenient, optional**.
- **Regardless of numbering,** every FR/BR/UXR MUST still satisfy **KG-R2** (≥1 task, same-session creation, bidirectional links). Prefer **one** primary delivery task in a **semantically correct** story over id pattern purity.

**Board Display Rules:**

- Epic Story Checklists in board views: S01 stories omitted (reduce clutter)
- Epic documents: S01 stories included in internal Story Checklist
- Kanban board: S01 stories not shown in epic sections
- Quick view board: S01 stories not shown in epic sections

**Rationale:**

- Repository stories are containers, not work units
- They grow indefinitely (FR-001 through FR-999+)
- Completion is not meaningful for repositories
- Board display omission reduces clutter (100+ tasks in S01)
- Still tracked internally for traceability and versioning

**Abstract Space Separation:**

- **S00 (Epic-Level Abstract Space):** `0.{EPIC}.0.0+0` - Epic-level abstract space only, no tasks
- **S01 (Repository Story):** `0.{EPIC}.1.0+0` - Story-level abstract space, contains repository tasks
- **Repository Tasks:** `0.{EPIC}.1.{TASK}+0` - Concrete tasks in repository story

### Tasks

Atomic units inside a story.

**CRITICAL: 3-Tier Structure Requirement**

All work MUST follow the explicit **3-tier structure**: Epic → Story → Task. This structure is **mandatory** and **non-negotiable**.

- **Epic** contains Stories (high-level scope)
- **Story** contains Tasks (releasable slices)
- **Task** is the atomic work unit (implementation detail)

**No implicit or inline tasks are permitted.** Every task MUST be explicitly documented at the Task tier.

**Task Document Requirements**

Every Task MUST have a discrete Task document (or clearly delimited section within the Story document using the Task ID as a header). Tasks cannot be implicit, bundled, or introduced inline.

**Task Document Formats:**

1. **Separate File Format (Recommended):**
   - Location: `kanban/epics/Epic-X/Story-XXX/Task-YYY-description.md` or `kanban/epics/Epic-X/Story-XXX/TYYY-description.md`
   - Example: `kanban/epics/Epic-4/Story-011/Task-001-update-kanban-policy.md`

2. **Delimited Section Format (Alternative):**
   - Location: Within the Story document, using Task ID as a clear header
   - Format: `### E{epic}:S{story}:T{task} – Task Name` followed by task content
   - Example: `### E4:S11:T01 – Update Kanban Governance Policy`

**Required Task Document Fields:**

Every Task document MUST include the following fields:

- **Task ID:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}` (e.g., `E4:S11:T01`)
- **Scope:** Clear description of what the task accomplishes
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Measurable criteria for task completion
- **Status:** Current status (TODO, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETE, or IN PROGRESS (PERPETUAL) for repository stories)
- **Version Anchor:** Version marker when task is complete (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.11.1+1)`)
- **Completion Date:** Date when task was completed (if applicable)
- **Related BR/FR Links:** Links to related Bug Reports or Feature Requests
- **Input:** What is required to start this task
- **Deliverable:** What is produced by this task
- **Dependencies:** Other tasks or work items this task depends on
- **Blocker:** Tasks or work items that block this task
- **Parallel Development Candidacy:** Whether this task can be worked on in parallel

**Prohibited Patterns:**

The following patterns are **explicitly prohibited**:

- ❌ **Implicit Tasks:** Tasks mentioned in Story text but not explicitly documented
- ❌ **Inline Tasks:** Tasks embedded in Story descriptions without Task ID
- ❌ **Bundled Tasks:** Multiple tasks described together without individual Task documents
- ❌ **Undocumented Tasks:** Tasks referenced in checklists without corresponding Task documents

**Task Numbering and Format:**

- **Numbering (example):** `Exx:Sxx:Txx` (Epic, Story, Task with 2-digit or 3-digit zero padding)
- **Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}` where task is:
  - **Regular tasks:** 2-digit (01-99)
  - **Perpetual tasks:** 3-digit (101+)
- **Example (regular):** `E20:S07:T10` = Epic 20, Story 7, Task 10
- **Example (regular):** `E1:S01:T01` = Epic 1, Story 1, Task 1
- **Example (perpetual):** `E2:S16:T03` = Epic 6, Story 7, Task 101 (UKW - perpetual task)
- **Example (perpetual):** `E2:S16:T03` = Epic 6, Story 7, Task 102 (CMW - perpetual task)
- **Tracked:** Git commits reference task ID (or equivalent in your VCS)

**Perpetual Task Range (T101+):**

- **Purpose:** Perpetual tasks are ongoing maintenance/synchronization tasks that never complete
- **Range:** T101+ (3-digit task numbers starting at 101)
- **Examples:** UKW (Update Kanban Workflow), CMW (Changelog Management Workflow)
- **Characteristics:**
  - Status: IN PROGRESS (Perpetual) - never transitions to COMPLETE
  - Build Warning Suppression: Enabled (high BUILD numbers expected and valid)
  - BUILD number = workflow run count (not feature iteration)
  - Task Type: Perpetual Maintenance
- **Rationale:**
  - Clear differentiation from regular tasks (3-digit vs 2-digit)
  - Unlimited capacity (no upper bound)
  - No conflicts with regular task range (T01-T99)
  - Visual clarity in task lists
- **Migration Note:** Perpetual tasks were migrated from regular task numbers (e.g., T08→T101, T12→T102) as part of repository story abstract space resolution (E9:S01:T08)
- **Required — Update task document per run:** For each run of a perpetual task, the **task document itself MUST be updated** with a brief record of: what was changed (files, scope), why (purpose, trigger), and the version of this release. This ensures forensic traceability for every run (not only in changelogs). Example: add an "Update History" or inline note in the task doc per release.

**Validation Requirements:**

The following validations MUST be enforced:

1. **Task Document Presence:** Every task referenced in a Story checklist MUST have a corresponding Task document
2. **Task ID Alignment:** Task ID in document MUST match Task ID in Story checklist
3. **Epic/Story/Task Alignment:** Task document MUST be located under the correct Epic and Story
4. **Required Fields:** Task document MUST contain all required fields listed above
5. **Version Alignment:** When task is complete, version TASK component MUST match Task number

**FR/BR → Task → Story → Epic Flow (Updated):**

1. **FR/BR arrives** (issue tracker, support channel, notes, etc.)
2. **Check for existing Story** that matches the FR/BR scope:
   - If found → create a **new Task document** under that Story
3. **If no Story exists** for this area:
   - Create a new Story under the **appropriate Epic**
   - Then create the **Task document** under that Story
4. **If no Epic exists** for this problem domain:
   - Create a new, conceptually broad **Epic** to host the new Story
   - Then create the Story under that Epic
   - Then create the **Task document** under that Story

**CRITICAL:** No FR/BR should exist without a corresponding **Task document** anchored to a Story (and, once epics are in use, an Epic). This keeps Kanban, versioning, and release workflow aligned.

---

## Versioning

### Schema

**Format:** `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`

- **RC:** Release Candidate (0 = development, 1+ = release candidate)
- **EPIC:** Epic number
- **STORY:** Story number within epic
- **TASK:** Task number within story
- **BUILD:** Build number (increments per release within task)

**Example:** `0.20.11.15+1` = Development, Epic 20, Story 11, Task 15, Build 1

**Related Documentation (examples):**
- **Versioning Policy (Schema)** – Complete schema definition (e.g., `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/versioning-policy.md`)
- **Versioning Strategy** – Forensic traceability and canonical ordering principles (e.g., `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/versioning-strategy.md`)

### Task-Level Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All substantive work MUST be task-driven.

**Version TASK number must match active task.**

**Requirements:**
1. Version TASK reflects the active task
   - Working on `E20:S11:T16` → version `0.20.11.16+B`
   - TASK component aligns with Kanban task

2. **CRITICAL: Task Transitions and Version File Updates**
   - **When creating a new Task:**
     - Update `version.py` with `VERSION_TASK = <new_task_number>`
     - Set `VERSION_BUILD = 1` (new Tasks always start at BUILD 1)
     - Example: Moving from Task 1 to Task 2:
       - Update: `VERSION_TASK = 2`, `VERSION_BUILD = 1`
       - Version: `0.4.3.2+1` (not `0.4.3.1+2`)
   - **During Release Workflow:**
     - Step 1: Validates that `VERSION_TASK` matches active Task number
     - Step 2: Automatically detects Task transitions and updates `VERSION_TASK` if needed
     - Step 2: If Task transition detected, resets `VERSION_BUILD` to 1
     - Step 2: If same Task, increments `VERSION_BUILD` by 1

3. BUILD resets to 1 with new task
   - BUILD increments within same task
   - BUILD does NOT carry over between tasks
   - **CRITICAL:** When moving to a new Task, `VERSION_BUILD` MUST be reset to 1

4. Validation enforces alignment
   - Release workflow Step 1 validates task/version alignment
   - Release workflow Step 2 validates task/version alignment after update
   - Validators check task/version alignment
   - Pre-commit hooks enforce alignment (if implemented)

5. **Implementation Cycle (adoptable):** Projects may require a mandatory Implementation Cycle (spec + TDD) for all task implementations: Requirement doc → Task creation → Specification & Test Creation (blocking) → Implementation (Red-Green-Refactor) → Release Workflow. When adopted, tests must exist and be failing before implementation starts. **Reference:** `.cursorrules` (Implementation Cycle section), `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/implementation-cycle-sop.md`.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ **DON'T:** Keep `VERSION_TASK = 1` and increment `VERSION_BUILD` when moving to Task 2
  - Wrong: `0.4.3.1+3` for Task 2
  - Correct: `0.4.3.2+1` for Task 2
- ❌ **DON'T:** Forget to reset `VERSION_BUILD` when moving to a new Task
  - Wrong: `0.4.3.2+3` for first release of Task 2
  - Correct: `0.4.3.2+1` for first release of Task 2

See: **your own canonical story docs** that define guardrails and versioning rules.  
(*Original example:* `docs/project-management/stories/overview/Epic 20/Story-11-GUARDRAILS-PLAN.md` in the Confidentia project.)

### Abstract Spaces for Forensic Traceability

**CRITICAL:** Zero-numbered E/S/T documentation establishes the **abstract space** for forensic traceability, serving as the canonical anchor before any functional work is committed.

**Purpose:**
- Establish canonical version anchor for E/S/T documentation
- Begin forensic traceability arc at documentation creation
- Provide clear SOP for committing initial E/S/T docs
- Link Kanban documentation lifecycle to versioning schema

#### Zero-Numbered E/S/T Documentation

Abstract spaces use `+0` build number to indicate documentation-only anchor:

**Epic-Level Abstract Space:**
- Format: `0.{EPIC}.0.0+0`
- Example: `0.3.0.0+0` = Epic 3's abstract space
- Purpose: Establishes forensic traceability anchor for Epic 3
- When: Created when Epic document is first committed

**Story-Level Abstract Space:**
- Format: `0.{EPIC}.{STORY}.0+0`
- Example: `0.2.5.0+0` = Epic 2 Story 5's abstract space
- Purpose: Establishes forensic traceability anchor for Story 5 within Epic 2
- When: Created when Story document is first committed

**Task-Level Abstract Space:**
- Format: `0.{EPIC}.{STORY}.{TASK}+0`
- Example: `0.10.4.6+0` = Epic 10 Story 4 Task 6's abstract space
- Purpose: Establishes forensic traceability anchor for Task 6 within Story 4 within Epic 10
- When: Created when Task document is first committed

**Relationship to Functional Work:**
- Abstract space (`+0`) = Documentation-only anchor (establishes traceability)
- Functional work (`+1` and beyond) = Actual implementation (builds on anchor)
- Example progression:
  - `0.4.11.1+0` = Task document created (abstract space)
  - `0.4.11.1+1` = First functional change for Task 1
  - `0.4.11.1+2` = Second functional change for Task 1

**See:** Numbering Policy section "Abstract Space Version Schema" for complementary versioning schema details.

#### SOP for Committing Initial E/S/T Docs

**When to Commit Abstract Space:**
- **Before any functional work** on the E/S/T
- **When creating new Epic/Story/Task documentation**
- **As part of documentation setup phase**

**Where to Commit:**
- **Epic:** Epic document location (e.g., `kanban/epics/Epic-X/Epic-X.md`)
- **Story:** Story document location (e.g., `kanban/epics/Epic-X/Story-XXX-*.md`)
- **Task:** Task document location (e.g., `kanban/epics/Epic-X/Story-XXX/Task-YYY-*.md` OR delimited section within Story)

**How to Commit:**
1. **Create E/S/T document** with required structure and fields
2. **Set version to abstract space** (`+0` build):
   - Epic: `0.{EPIC}.0.0+0`
   - Story: `0.{EPIC}.{STORY}.0+0`
   - Task: `0.{EPIC}.{STORY}.{TASK}+0`
3. **Commit via Release Workflow (RW)** with doc-init path (see FR-017)
   - RW Step 1 detects docs-only change
   - RW Step 2 sets version to `+0` (abstract space)
   - RW Step 3 creates changelog entry with "Doc Init" type
4. **Alternative:** Manual commit with explicit version annotation
   - Commit message: `📋 Doc Init (Abstract Space): E{epic}:S{story}:T{task} - [Description]`
   - Version: Explicitly set to abstract space (`+0`)

**Validation:**
- Release Workflow validates abstract space version format
- Validators check that `+0` is only used for docs-only changes
- Validators ensure abstract space precedes functional work

**Related:**
- **FR-017:** Versioning Policy Hardening — Doc-Init Build (+0) for New E/S/T (implementation)
- **Numbering Policy:** Abstract Space Version Schema (complementary section)

## Release Workflow

The process that implements both policies (Kanban Governance and Versioning Strategy).

**Reference (example):** `docs/documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-reference.md`

**Documents (example set):**
1. Version File (e.g., `src/yourproject/version.py`)
2. Detailed Changelog (e.g., `CHANGELOG_vRC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD.md`)
3. Main Changelog (e.g., `CHANGELOG.md`)
4. README (e.g., `README.md`)
5. Epic Doc (auto-updated)
6. Story Docs (auto-updated)
7. Kanban Board (auto-updated)
8. Branch Context Validator
9. Changelog Format Validator
10. Kanban Update Module

**Process:**
1. Version Bump
   - `--task N` sets task (resets BUILD to 1)
   - `--story N` sets story (resets TASK and BUILD to 1)
   - Otherwise increments BUILD on current task
   - Validates task exists and version TASK matches

2. Changelog Creation
   - Detailed changelog with full timestamp
   - Main CHANGELOG.md with summary

3. Kanban Auto-Update
   - Updates epic/story docs with version and summary
   - Updates completed tasks with version numbers
   - Updates Kanban board entry
   - Validates forensic markers were added

4. Validation
   - Branch context (epic ↔ version ↔ changelog, task/version alignment)
   - Changelog format (timestamp)
   - Task exists in story doc
   - Version TASK matches provided task

5. Git Operations
   - Stage all files
   - Commit with version in message
   - Create annotated tag
   - Push to remote

---

## Operational Principles

These principles govern how Release Workflow and Kanban updates are executed, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and reliability.

### Atomic Release Workflow Behaviour

**CRITICAL:** Release Workflow (RW) must execute atomically—either complete all steps or stop with an explicit BLOCKED state.

**Requirement:**
- When user triggers RW (e.g., types 'RW'), the agent MUST either:
  - Complete all workflow steps to completion, OR
  - Stop at a specific step with a clear 'RW BLOCKED' message

**Blocked Protocol:**
If RW cannot proceed, the agent MUST state:
- **Step:** Step number and name (e.g., 'Step 7: Run Validators')
- **Reason:** Why blocked (e.g., wrong branch, missing tool, sandbox limitation)
- **Actions:** Exact commands user must run to unblock
- **Status:** That RW is NOT complete until actions are taken

**Agent MUST NOT:**
- Silently stop mid-workflow after modifying files
- Start new RW while previous RW TODOs are pending/in_progress

**Abandoned Protocol:**
If RW is abandoned:
- Mark remaining `rw-step-*` TODOs as cancelled
- Output short 'RW ABORTED' summary
- State current state and next steps

**Rationale:**
- **Accessibility:** Critical for users with cognitive constraints who need clear, unambiguous status
- **Clarity:** User always knows workflow status (complete, blocked, or aborted)
- **Safety:** Prevents ambiguous states where it's unclear if workflow succeeded or failed

**Enforcement:**
- `.cursorrules` (or equivalent automation) must enforce atomicity
- Release Workflow documentation must emphasize this requirement
- Agents must follow ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern

---

### "ALL Sections" Update Requirement

**CRITICAL:** When Release Workflow updates Kanban documentation, it MUST update ALL sections that reference the story/task being released.

**Requirement:**
Step 4 (Update KB Epic Docs) MUST update:
- **Header metadata:** `Last updated` field with version marker
- **Story Checklist:** Status and version marker (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- **Detailed story sections:** Status, Last updated, task checkboxes with forensic markers
- **Any other references:** All sections mentioning the story/task

**Systematic Process:**
1. Read the FULL Epic document file
2. Read the authoritative Story document file to get correct state
3. Find ALL sections referencing the story/task (use grep/search)
4. Update ALL of them to match the Story file's state
5. Validate consistency: header, checklist, and detailed sections must all match

**Validation Checks:**
- Epic header `Last updated` matches version in Story Checklist
- Story Checklist status matches Story file status
- Detailed sections match Story Checklist
- No duplicate progress sections
- All forensic markers present and correctly formatted

**Enforcement:**
- `.cursorrules` explicitly requires 'ALL sections'
- Release Workflow documentation emphasizes systematic process
- Agents must follow ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern

**Rationale:**
- Prevents documentation inconsistencies
- Ensures single source of truth (Story Checklist) is reflected everywhere
- Enables reliable traceability across all documentation

---

### Accessibility Constraints

**CRITICAL:** All workflow operations must be accessible, with no partial updates, no silent failures, and clear actionable messages.

**Requirements:**

**No Partial Updates:**
- RW must complete all steps OR stop with explicit BLOCKED message
- Cannot silently stop mid-workflow after modifying files
- Cannot leave documentation in inconsistent state

**No Silent Failures:**
- Must state step number and name when blocked
- Must state reason for blocking
- Must provide exact commands to unblock
- Must state that RW is NOT complete

**Clear Actionable Messages:**
- **RW BLOCKED:** `Step X - Reason - Actions required`
- **RW ABORTED:** `Current state - Next steps`
- **RW COMPLETE:** `All steps completed successfully`

**Rationale:**
- **Cognitive accessibility:** Users with cognitive constraints need clear, unambiguous status
- **Error recovery:** Clear messages enable users to understand and fix issues
- **Trust:** Users can verify workflow completion status

**Enforcement:**
- All agent-driven workflows must follow these constraints
- Documentation must emphasize accessibility as a core requirement
- Validation checks must verify message clarity

---

### Forensic Marker Standardization

**CRITICAL:** Forensic markers must follow a canonical format and be placed consistently across all documentation.

**Canonical Format:**
```
✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)
```

**Examples:**
- Story: `- [x] **Story 33 – Parent Inclusivity** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.33.3+1)`
- Task: `- [x] **E4:S33:T01 – Task Name** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.33.1+1)` (using Exx:Sxx:Txx format)

**Location Requirements:**
- **Story Checklist:** Epic document, Story Checklist section (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- **Task Checklist:** Story document, Task Checklist section
- **Detailed Sections:** Epic document, detailed story sections (for consistency)

**Consistency Requirements:**
- Story Checklist is SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for story status
- Detailed sections must match Story Checklist
- Header `Last updated` must match version in markers
- ALL sections must be updated together

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Forensic marker present in Story Checklist
- [ ] Forensic marker present in Task Checklist (if task complete)
- [ ] Forensic marker format matches canonical format
- [ ] Version in marker matches version in header
- [ ] All sections referencing story/task have consistent markers

**Enforcement:**
- Release Workflow must validate forensic marker format
- Templates must include format examples
- Documentation must emphasize Story Checklist as SoT

---

### Consistency Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All Kanban documentation must be consistent across board views, Epic docs, and Story docs.

**Cross-Reference Validation:**
- **Epic header ↔ Story Checklist:** `Last updated` field must match version in Story Checklist
- **Story Checklist ↔ Detailed sections:** Status and version markers must match
- **Board view ↔ Epic docs:** Board status must match Epic Story Checklist
- **Epic docs ↔ Story docs:** Epic detailed sections must match Story file

**Regular Consistency Checks:**
- After each Release Workflow execution
- Before major releases
- Weekly board reviews
- Monthly policy reviews

**Validation Process:**
1. Read Epic document header
2. Read Epic Story Checklist
3. Read Epic detailed story sections
4. Read Story document
5. Read board view
6. Compare all references for consistency
7. Fix any inconsistencies found

**Enforcement:**
- Release Workflow must validate consistency as part of Step 4
- Board review rituals must include consistency checks
- Policy violations must trigger escalation procedures

---

### Review Schedules

**CRITICAL:** Regular reviews ensure documentation stays current and consistent.

**Epic Reviews:**
- **Frequency:** After each story completion
- **Responsibility:** Epic owner / Story owner
- **Checks:**
  - Epic header `Last updated` current
  - Story Checklist accurate
  - Detailed sections match Story files
  - Dependencies and risks updated

**Story Reviews:**
- **Frequency:** After each task completion
- **Responsibility:** Story owner
- **Checks:**
  - Story status accurate
  - Task Checklist accurate
  - Acceptance criteria met
  - Dependencies updated

**Board Reviews:**
- **Frequency:** Weekly or after significant changes
- **Responsibility:** Project manager / Kanban maintainer
- **Checks:**
  - Board view matches Epic docs
  - Status columns accurate
  - No orphaned stories/tasks
  - Epic priorities current

**Policy Reviews:**
- **Frequency:** Quarterly or after major framework updates
- **Responsibility:** Framework maintainer
- **Checks:**
  - Policy aligns with framework updates
  - Templates match policy
  - Integration guides current

---

### Maintenance Responsibilities

**CRITICAL:** Clear ownership ensures documentation is maintained consistently.

**Epic Owner Responsibilities:**
- Update Epic header after story completion
- Update Story Checklist after story completion
- Update detailed sections after story completion
- Review dependencies and risks regularly
- Ensure Epic docs align with Story files

**Story Owner Responsibilities:**
- Update Story status after task completion
- Update Task Checklist after task completion
- Update acceptance criteria status
- Review dependencies regularly
- Ensure Story file is authoritative source

**Kanban Maintainer Responsibilities:**
- Update board views regularly
- Ensure board ↔ Epic ↔ Story consistency
- Review for orphaned items
- Coordinate policy updates
- Escalate policy violations

**Framework Maintainer Responsibilities:**
- Review policy quarterly
- Update templates to match policy
- Update integration guides
- Coordinate framework updates across projects

---

### Escalation Procedures

**CRITICAL:** Clear escalation paths ensure issues are resolved promptly.

**Documentation Inconsistencies:**
- **Severity:** High
- **Trigger:** Epic header, Story Checklist, and detailed sections don't match
- **Action:**
  1. Identify authoritative source (Story file)
  2. Update ALL sections to match authoritative source
  3. Document inconsistency in changelog if significant
  4. Notify Epic owner and Kanban maintainer

**Missing Reviews:**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Trigger:** Review schedule missed (e.g., Epic not updated after story completion)
- **Action:**
  1. Remind Epic owner of review responsibility
  2. If no response after 2 days, escalate to Kanban maintainer
  3. Kanban maintainer updates or assigns alternative owner

**Policy Violations:**
- **Severity:** High
- **Trigger:** Work item doesn't follow Kanban governance policy
- **Action:**
  1. Identify violation (e.g., missing forensic marker, inconsistent status)
  2. Notify work item owner
  3. Provide guidance on correct format/process
  4. If repeated, escalate to Kanban maintainer

**Blocked Workflows:**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Trigger:** RW blocked and not resolved after 24 hours
- **Action:**
  1. Review blocked reason
  2. Assist with unblocking (if technical issue)
  3. If user action required, remind user
  4. If abandoned, mark RW as ABORTED and document

**Escalation Contacts:**
- **Epic owner:** First point of contact for Epic-level issues
- **Story owner:** First point of contact for Story-level issues
- **Kanban maintainer:** Second point of contact for policy violations and consistency issues
- **Framework maintainer:** Final point of contact for framework-level issues

---

### Mandatory TODO Tracking

**CRITICAL:** Real-time progress visibility is mandatory for all agent-driven workflows.

**Requirement:**
TODO tracking is **MANDATORY** (not optional) for Release Workflow and other agent-driven workflows.

**Implementation:**

**At Workflow Start:**
- Create TODO list with all workflow steps
- Mark all steps as `pending`

**Before Each Step:**
- Mark step as `in_progress`

**After Each Step:**
- Mark step as `completed`
- Mark next step as `in_progress`

**On Completion:**
- All steps marked as `completed`

**Enforcement:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** execute Release Workflow without creating TODO list first
- ❌ **DO NOT** skip TODO updates between steps
- ✅ **MUST** create TODO list before Step 1 execution
- ✅ **MUST** update TODO status before and after each step
- ✅ **MUST** mark all steps as completed on successful completion

**Benefits:**
- **User visibility:** User sees real-time progress through all steps
- **Agent organization:** Helps agent stay organized across sequential steps
- **Error recovery:** Clear visibility into where execution stopped if interrupted
- **Transparency:** User can verify all steps completed successfully
- **Accessibility:** Critical for users with cognitive constraints

**Enforcement:**
- `.cursorrules` (or equivalent automation) must require TODO tracking
- Release Workflow documentation must emphasize this requirement
- Validation checks must verify TODO tracking is present

---

## Documentation

**Epics** reference:
- Branch name, version schema, story checklist, dependencies, risks

**Stories** include:
- Task index aligning with E#S#T# numbering
- Goals and acceptance criteria
- Completion summary before release

**Tasks** capture:
- Cross-team impacts (Parallel Development Candidacy)
- Staging plan if spanning multiple PRs

**Templates:**
- New epic/story created from templates (e.g., those in the Kanban package)
- Deviations should be reviewed/approved by whoever owns process governance in your context

---

## Rules

1. **Traceability:** Every board card links to KB doc, branch/tag, changelog entry
2. **Single Source of Truth:** KB docs are canonical
3. **Gate Conditions:**
   - Ready → In Progress: Story doc complete, blockers resolved, branch created
   - In Progress → Verify: Tasks checked, summary drafted, dry-run done
   - Verify → Done: Release workflow executed, tag pushed, KB doc accepted
4. **Numbering Discipline:** No duplicate IDs; IDs never reused
5. **WIP & Ownership:** Each story has named DRI; pause >48h moves back to Ready

---

---

## Change History

- **2025-12-02:** Added 9 Operational Principles sections (Atomic RW Behaviour, "ALL Sections" Requirement, Accessibility Constraints, Forensic Marker Standardization, Consistency Requirements, Review Schedules, Maintenance Responsibilities, Escalation Procedures, Mandatory TODO Tracking) - based on fynd.deals Epic 15 findings
- **2025-11-26:** Refined task-level versioning requirements (original Confidentia example: Epic 20, Story 11, Task 011)
- **2025-11-26:** Updated to reference RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD schema, defined all Release Workflow documents (original Confidentia example: Epic 20, Story 11, Task 015)
- **2025-11-20:** Initial policy authored (original Confidentia example: Epic 20 Story 6/7 follow-up)

---

## Portability Notes

When adopting this policy in a new project:

- **Update paths** to match your KB layout (e.g., where Epics, Stories, and Kanban board files live).
- **Confirm versioning**:
