## Technical Details

### Integration Components

**Task Creation Process:**
1. Identify maintenance need
2. Assess and prioritize (using prioritization framework)
3. Create Kanban task (Epic 7, appropriate Story)
4. Update Kanban board (MoSCoW section, status)

**Prioritization Mapping:**
- Critical Priority (4.0-5.0) → Must Have (M)
- High Priority (3.0-3.9) → Should Have (S)
- Medium Priority (2.0-2.9) → Could Have (C)
- Low Priority (1.0-1.9) → Could Have (C)
- Minimal Priority (<1.0) → Won't Have (W)

**Task Lifecycle:**
- TODO: Task created, not started
- IN PROGRESS: Work begun
- COMPLETE: Task finished and verified
- PERPETUAL: Ongoing task (e.g., IDE-flagged issues)

**Epic 4 Integration:**
- Uses Epic 4 task templates
- Follows Epic 4 document structure
- Integrates with Epic 4 workflows (RW, UKW)
- Uses Epic 4 versioning schema
- Follows Epic 4 board organization

### Workflow Integration

**IDE-Flagged Issues:**
- Create tasks (E7:S01:T01 perpetual or specific)
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Track progress and completion
- Include in RW

**Prioritized Maintenance:**
- Create task with prioritization
- Assign MoSCoW classification
- Track through lifecycle
- Include in RW

**Scheduled Maintenance:**
- Create batch tasks
- Prioritize and group issues
- Track batch progress
- Generate reports

**Emergency Maintenance:**
- Create urgent task
- Bypass normal process
- Track emergency fix
- Document and follow-up
