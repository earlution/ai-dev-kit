# Release v0.1.2.2+1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-02 00:00:00 UTC

**Epic / Story / Task:** Epic 1, Story 2, Task 2  
**Type:** 📚 Documentation

---

## 📋 Summary

This release completes **Task 2: Document modularity principles and boundaries**. A comprehensive modularity principles document has been created, establishing clear boundaries between packages, dependency rules, consumption patterns, and integration guidelines.

---

## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 2 Completion

- ✅ **Modularity Principles Document Created:**
  - Defined what "modular" means for ai-dev-kit
  - Established package boundaries for all three frameworks
  - Documented copy vs reference patterns
  - Defined dependency rules (hard vs soft/optional)
  - Documented package independence rules
  - Established consumption patterns (standalone, combined, incremental)
  - Defined customization boundaries
  - Documented integration patterns

- ✅ **Core Principles Established:**
  - **Standalone First:** Each package must work independently
  - **Copy, Don't Reference:** Packages are copied into projects, not referenced
  - **Soft Dependencies:** Dependencies are optional, not required
  - **Clear Boundaries:** Each package has well-defined scope

- ✅ **Package Boundaries Defined:**
  - Workflow Management: Owns workflow execution, RW trigger, validation
  - Numbering & Versioning: Owns versioning schema, policy, strategy
  - Kanban: Owns Kanban governance, templates, FR/BR intake

- ✅ **Dependency Rules Established:**
  - No hard dependencies between packages
  - Soft/optional dependencies allowed and documented
  - Integration dependencies are optional and well-documented

- ✅ **Consumption Patterns Documented:**
  - Standalone: Use one package independently
  - Combined: Use multiple packages together
  - Incremental: Start with one, add more over time

### Key Sections

**Modularity Definition:**
- Standalone capability
- Self-contained packages
- Flexible consumption
- Clear boundaries

**Package Boundaries:**
- Workflow Management scope and responsibility
- Numbering & Versioning scope and responsibility
- Kanban scope and responsibility

**Copy vs Reference:**
- Copy, don't reference principle
- Customization boundaries
- Reference patterns (when appropriate)

**Dependency Rules:**
- Hard dependencies (not allowed)
- Soft/optional dependencies (allowed)
- Integration dependencies (optional, well-documented)

**Integration Patterns:**
- Workflow Management ↔ Numbering & Versioning
- Kanban ↔ Numbering & Versioning
- Kanban ↔ Workflow Management
- All three packages together

## 💡 Key Findings / Learnings

- **Modularity Foundation:** Clear principles established for package independence and integration
- **Boundary Clarity:** Each package has well-defined scope and responsibility
- **Flexible Consumption:** Users can choose standalone, combined, or incremental adoption
- **Integration Guidelines:** Clear patterns for optional integration between packages

## 📝 Notes

This modularity principles document provides the foundation for creating the dependency matrix (T003), documenting consumption patterns (T004), and updating package READMEs (T005). It establishes the rules and guidelines that govern how packages interact and how users consume them.

**Files Created:**
- `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-1/stories/Story-002-package-and-repo-architecture/T002-modularity-principles.md` (comprehensive modularity principles document)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Task 3:** Create visual package dependency matrix
- **Task 4:** Document consumption patterns for each framework with detailed examples
- **Task 5:** Update package READMEs with modularity information
