## Release v0.4.16.4+1 – Kanban Package Integration Alignment Review

- **Release Date:** 2026-01-20 11:39:55 UTC
- **Epic:** 4 – Kanban Framework  
- **Story:** 16 – Kanban Package Implementation Review  
- **Task:** 4 – Review integrations and dependency alignment  

---

### Summary

This release advances the **Kanban Package Implementation Review** by completing the **integration and dependency alignment** work for the Kanban framework package. It validates how the Kanban framework integrates with the **Numbering & Versioning** and **Workflow Management** frameworks (including RW and UKW), and confirms that the dev-kit's implementation matches the documented integration guides.

### Details

#### E4:S16:T04 – Review integrations and dependency alignment

- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
- **Version:** `v0.4.16.4+1`  
- **Scope:**  
  - Review integration points and dependency alignment between:
    - Kanban framework package
    - Numbering & Versioning framework
    - Workflow Management framework (Release Workflow + UKW)
  - Confirm that documented integration behavior matches the dev-kit implementation.
  - Identify any structural or configuration gaps that could block RC sign-off.

**Key Activities:**

- **Kanban ↔ Numbering & Versioning Integration**
  - Verified `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` schema is consistently used for Kanban-related releases.
  - Confirmed forensic markers in Story/Epic checklists and headers match the integration guide:
    - Story 016 uses version markers like `✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.16.1+1)` and `✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.16.2+1)`.
    - Epic 4 tracks Story 16 progress with the correct version anchors.
  - Ensured Kanban’s expectations baseline (forensic traceability via version markers and Story Checklist as SoT) matches actual implementation.

- **Kanban ↔ Workflow Management (Release Workflow) Integration**
  - Reviewed `release-workflow.yaml` and RW documentation to confirm that:
    - The Kanban update step is wired to `update_kanban_docs.py`.
    - RW updates Kanban docs (Epic/Story metadata, checklists, and forensic markers) as documented.
  - Confirmed `.cursorrules` aligns with the integration guide, including:
    - RW triggering
    - Kanban update behavior
    - Dual-tagging and SemVer integration for releases.
  - Verified recent Kanban-related RWs (E4:S16, E4:S17, E4:S14) updated:
    - Kanban board MoSCOW sections
    - Epic 4 and Story 016 `Last updated` and `Version` fields.

- **Kanban ↔ UKW (Update Kanban Workflow) Integration**
  - Validated UKW configuration:
    - `kanban_root`, `epic_doc_pattern`, `story_doc_pattern`, and `task_doc_pattern` correctly target dev-kit’s Kanban docs.
    - Perpetual UKW task is wired as E6:S07:T101 with `perpetual_task: true`.
  - Confirmed that UKW uses Kanban’s document structure and perpetual task wiring as intended.
  - Noted that the **MoSCOW prioritization gap** (tracked via BR-034) is a **workflow behavior issue**, not an integration-wiring defect in the Kanban package.

- **Dependency Model (Hard vs Soft Dependencies)**
  - Re-validated Kanban’s dependency model from the README and governance policy:
    - **Hard dependencies:** Git, Markdown.
    - **Soft dependencies:** Numbering & Versioning, Workflow Management (optional but recommended).
  - Confirmed dev-kit’s installation layout matches this model and does not introduce circular dependencies.

---

### Findings

- **Integration Status:** ✅ Aligned
  - Kanban ↔ Numbering & Versioning: Integration behavior (forensic markers, headers, and schema) matches documentation.
  - Kanban ↔ Workflow Management (RW): RW configuration and behavior match the integration guide, including Kanban updates and version alignment.
  - Kanban ↔ UKW: Structural integration is correct; behavior gap is tracked separately in BR-034.

- **Risks & Gaps:**
  - No structural or configuration misalignments found that would block RC sign-off for the Kanban framework.
  - Known behavior gap:
    - **BR-034 – UKW MoSCOW prioritization missing**: UKW does not yet fully maintain the MoSCOW Prioritized In-Progress Tasks section as documented. This is treated as a **workflow behavior bug**, not a Kanban-package integration flaw.

---

### Impact

- **For Kanban Framework RC Readiness:**
  - Confirms that the Kanban framework’s integration with Numbering & Versioning and Workflow Management is sound.
  - Clears integration/dependency-alignment as a potential RC blocker for the Kanban package.

- **For Future Work:**
  - Remaining work for E4:S16 is focused on:
    - Consolidating a **gap log and risk assessment** (T05).
    - Defining **RC sign-off criteria and remediation tasks** (T06).
  - UKW behavior improvements will continue under the existing BR/Task pair (BR-034 / E6:S01:T34).
