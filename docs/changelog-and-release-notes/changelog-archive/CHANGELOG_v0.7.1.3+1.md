## Added

### Maintenance Workflow Processes

- **Workflow processes document** (`docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/maintenance-workflow-processes.md`)
  - **Workflow 1: IDE-Flagged Issues Workflow**
    - Continuous monitoring and resolution process
    - Integration with RW Step 9
    - Batch processing for efficiency
    - 7-step workflow (detection, categorization, prioritization, batch processing, resolution, verification, release integration)
  - **Workflow 2: Prioritized Maintenance Workflow**
    - Systematic prioritization-driven maintenance
    - Uses prioritization framework for decision-making
    - Kanban-based tracking and management
    - 7-step workflow (task identification, assessment, priority calculation, Kanban assignment, planning, implementation, completion)
  - **Workflow 3: Scheduled Maintenance Workflow**
    - Periodic comprehensive maintenance reviews
    - Batch processing for accumulated technical debt
    - Weekly/monthly/quarterly schedules
    - 6-step workflow (planning, discovery, batch prioritization, batch execution, verification, release)
  - **Workflow 4: Emergency Maintenance Workflow**
    - Rapid response to critical issues
    - Bypass normal prioritization for urgent fixes
    - 5-step workflow (identification, rapid assessment, emergency fix, verification, documentation)
  - **Workflow Integration**
    - Release Workflow (RW) Step 9 integration
    - Update Kanban Workflow (UKW) integration
    - Framework health monitoring integration
  - **Kanban Integration**
    - Epic/Story assignment guidance
    - Task creation and metadata
    - Progress tracking and reporting
  - **Best Practices**
    - Regular maintenance frequency guidelines
    - Batch processing efficiency tips
    - Continuous improvement practices
  - **Examples**
    - IDE error resolution example
    - Code quality batch fix example
    - Technical debt resolution example

## Technical Details

### Workflow Components

**IDE-Flagged Issues Workflow:**
- Issue detection (IDE, linter, static analysis, manual review)
- Issue categorization (errors, warnings, info)
- Prioritization using framework
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Resolution with quality checks
- Verification and release integration

**Prioritized Maintenance Workflow:**
- Task identification from multiple sources
- Initial assessment (severity, impact, effort)
- Priority calculation with contextual adjustments
- Kanban assignment (MoSCoW classification)
- Work planning and resource allocation
- Implementation with quality assurance
- Completion and release integration

**Scheduled Maintenance Workflow:**
- Maintenance planning (scope, goals, schedule)
- Comprehensive issue discovery
- Batch prioritization and formation
- Batch execution in priority order
- Verification and reporting
- Release and documentation

**Emergency Maintenance Workflow:**
- Critical issue identification
- Rapid assessment and bypass normal process
- Emergency fix implementation
- Immediate verification
- Documentation and follow-up

### Integration Points

**Release Workflow (RW):**
- RW Step 9: Check for and address IDE-flagged problems
- Process: Run IDE checks → Identify issues → Address errors → Note warnings/info → Proceed with release

**Update Kanban Workflow (UKW):**
- UKW maintenance detection
- Create prioritized tasks from findings
- Track maintenance progress in Kanban

**Framework Health Monitoring:**
- Health-based maintenance prioritization
- Track health improvement from maintenance
- Use health metrics for planning
