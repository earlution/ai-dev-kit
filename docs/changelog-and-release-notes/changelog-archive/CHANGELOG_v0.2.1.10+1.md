## Summary

Implemented the first-pass release changes for `E2:S01:T10` to support a `dev` branch operating mode in RW branch-validation governance and to re-home UXR traceability from legacy repository mapping into contextualized RW story ownership.

## Change Type

- Enhancement (workflow governance and validator policy surface)
- Documentation and kanban traceability updates

## Changes Implemented

### Workflow and governance updates

- Added and contextualized `UXR-006` around solo-dev `dev` branch workflow usage for RW.
- Re-homed active implementation mapping to `E2:S01:T10` from generic UXR repository anchoring.
- Removed legacy `E7:S00:T06` trace references that created extra admin overhead.

### Validation and release intent

- Release executed with explicit task intent `RW -k E2:S01:T10`.
- RW task-intent guard validated in `rw-k` mode before modifications.

## Verification Notes

- Change implemented; behavioral verification of `dev` branch acceptance semantics is pending follow-up validator implementation task work.
