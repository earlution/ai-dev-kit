## Per-gate detail

### Gate 1 — Governance source-of-truth alignment

- Status: **PASS** (severity: `block`)
- Summary: All governance artefacts (.cursorrules, RW guide, kanban policy) codify FR-092 contract.
- Findings:
  - No IPW governance doc found that references FR-091/FR-084/FR-092. Recommend cross-linking from IPW guide for cross-doc consistency.
- Evidence:
  - `.cursorrules`: `OK`
  - `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`: `OK`
  - `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`: `OK`
  - `ipw_governance`: `MISSING (info)`

### Gate 2 — Predecessor closure & supersede-chain consistency

- Status: **PASS** (severity: `block`)
- Summary: Supersede chain executed: FR-091/FR-090/FR-084 banner-superseded, T02/T05/T06 redirected, BR-069/BR-070/UXR-009 gated.

  - `BR-042`: `OK (closed as duplicate)`

### Gate 3 — Contract enforcement parity (RW <-> UKW canonical pipeline)

- Status: **PASS** (severity: `block`)
- Summary: RW and UKW canonical row transform pipelines produce byte-identical output across all active boards (FR-090 shared engine verified).
- Evidence:
  - `docs/project-management/kanban/kboard.md`: `byte-identical`
  - `docs/project-management/kanban/fbuboard.md`: `byte-identical`
  - `docs/project-management/kanban/kanban-board.md`: `byte-identical`
  - `docs/project-management/kanban/fr-br-uxr-board.md`: `byte-identical`

### Gate 4 — Corpus canonical state

- Status: **PASS** (severity: `block`)
- Summary: Corpus canonical state holds: every active board is idempotent under canonical sweep; no duplicate tails; no synthetic stamps.
- Evidence:
  - `/Users/rms/Documents/projects/ai-dev-kit/docs/project-management/kanban/kboard.md`: `{'rows_changed': 0, 'rows_with_duplicate_footers': 0}`
  - `/Users/rms/Documents/projects/ai-dev-kit/docs/project-management/kanban/fbuboard.md`: `{'rows_changed': 0, 'rows_with_duplicate_footers': 0}`
  - `/Users/rms/Documents/projects/ai-dev-kit/docs/project-management/kanban/kanban-board.md`: `{'rows_changed': 0, 'rows_with_duplicate_footers': 0}`
  - `/Users/rms/Documents/projects/ai-dev-kit/docs/project-management/kanban/fr-br-uxr-board.md`: `{'rows_changed': 0, 'rows_with_duplicate_footers': 0}`
  - `stamp_evidence_aggregate`: `{'stamps_appended_with_evidence': 0, 'stamps_skipped_no_evidence': 0, 'stamps_preserved_existing': 109}`

### Gate 5 — Stage-set completeness (BR-070)

- Status: **PASS** (severity: `warn`)
- Summary: No four-surface report present; stage-set completeness vacuously satisfied (info).
- Waiver: No Step-7 report available; nothing to stage-check.
- Evidence:
  - `report`: `None`

### Gate 6 — Forensic stamp evidence (UXR-009)

- Status: **PASS** (severity: `warn`)
- Summary: No four-surface report present; stamp evidence check skipped.
- Waiver: No Step-7 report; UXR-009 forensic counters unavailable.
- Evidence:
  - `report`: `None`

### Gate 7 — Four-surface parity (FR-084)

- Status: **PASS** (severity: `warn`)
- Summary: No four-surface report present; four-surface parity check vacuously satisfied (info).
- Waiver: No Step-7 report; nothing to verify.
- Evidence:
