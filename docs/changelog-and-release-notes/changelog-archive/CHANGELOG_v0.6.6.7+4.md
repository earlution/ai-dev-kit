# Detailed Changelog: v0.6.6.7+4

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18 00:15:00 UTC  
**Epic:** 6 - Framework Management  
**Story:** 6 - ADK Implementation Analysis and Package Management  
**Task:** 7 - Implement framework hardening recommendations  
**Version:** 0.6.6.7+4

---

## Summary

This release implements Phase 3 (HIGH) remaining work: Created comprehensive `.cursorrules` file in project root. This completes the source repository frameworks requirement, providing a complete reference implementation for ADK frameworks.

## DO Phase

### Phase 3: Source Repository Frameworks (HIGH) - .cursorrules Creation

**Problem:** ai-dev-kit source repository lacked comprehensive `.cursorrules` file with RW trigger, UKW trigger, lifecycle management, git restrictions, version schema, and branch mapping.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Created comprehensive `.cursorrules` file in project root:
   - **Release Workflow (RW) Trigger Section:**
     - Comprehensive 12-step RW trigger with config-driven approach
     - Mandatory branch safety check (Step 1)
     - Detailed step-by-step process with config support
     - Progress tracking with Cursor TODOs
     - Complete file paths for ai-dev-kit project
     - Version schema and branch mapping documentation
   
   - **Package Version Workflow (PVW) Trigger Section:**
     - 6-step PVW trigger with intelligent agent-driven execution
     - Version bump criteria (guidance, not rules)
     - Integration with RW (Step 2.5)
   
   - **Update Kanban Workflow (UKW) Trigger Section:**
     - 8-step UKW trigger with bottom-up approach
     - Agentic intelligence requirements clearly documented
     - Config-driven approach with default paths for ai-dev-kit
     - MoSCoW prioritization guidance
   
   - **Document Lifecycle Management Section:**
     - Lifecycle metadata requirements (evergreen, timeboxed, transient)
     - Housekeeping policy (keep, archive, delete)
     - Automated management guidance
   
   - **Git Workflow Restrictions Section:**
     - Strict rules (commits via RW only, pushes via RW only)
     - Prohibited operations (manual git commit/push)
     - Enforcement mechanisms
   
   - **Version Schema Section:**
     - ADK Version Schema: `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`
     - Schema calculation rules
     - Epic ranges (1-23 canonical, 24+ project-specific)
     - Examples and references
   
   - **Branch Mapping Section:**
     - Branch naming convention: `epic/{N}-{description}`
     - Branch types (main, epic branches)
     - Epic branch workflow (critical rules)
     - Validation requirements
   
   - **Project-Specific Rules Section:**
     - AI Dev Kit framework rules
     - Canonical epics documentation
     - Version file location (legacy path documented)
     - Configuration approach
     - Custom workflows (RW, UKW, PVW)

2. Updated Task document acceptance criteria:
   - Marked `.cursorrules` file creation as complete

### Files Modified

**Created Files:**
- `.cursorrules` (project root - comprehensive cursor rules file)

**Modified Files:**
- `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-6/Story-006-adk-implementation-analysis-and-package-management/T07-implement-framework-hardening-recommendations.md` (acceptance criteria updated)

**Version File:**
- `src/fynd_deals/version.py` (updated to v0.6.6.7+4)

---

## ACT Phase

### Impact

**Source Repository Completeness:**
- ai-dev-kit now serves as complete reference implementation
- Comprehensive `.cursorrules` file demonstrates framework usage
- All workflow triggers documented and ready for use
- Configuration approach clearly demonstrated

**Framework Hardening:**
- Phase 3 source repository frameworks requirement complete
- `.cursorrules` file provides complete reference for client projects
- All required sections present and properly formatted
- ai-dev-kit-specific paths and examples included

**Reference Implementation:**
- Source repository now demonstrates own frameworks
- Client projects can reference `.cursorrules` as template
- Complete example of config-driven workflow approach
- All canonical structures demonstrated

### Next Steps

**Remaining Work for E6:S06:T07:**
1. **Phase 3 Completion:**
   - Version file migration (optional - from `src/fynd_deals/version.py` to `src/ai_dev_kit/version.py`)
   - Update all references to version file path if migration occurs

**E6:S06:T07 Progress:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Epic 9 → Epic 24 rename (v0.6.6.7+1)
- ✅ Phase 2: Installer validation (v0.6.6.7+2)
- ✅ Phase 3: `rw-config.yaml` created (v0.6.6.7+1)
- ✅ Phase 3: `.cursorrules` created (this release)
- ✅ Phase 4: Installation instructions improved (v0.6.6.7+3)

**All Critical Phases Complete:**
- Phase 1 ✅ (CRITICAL)
- Phase 2 ✅ (CRITICAL)
- Phase 3 ✅ (HIGH - .cursorrules complete, version file migration optional)
- Phase 4 ✅ (HIGH)
