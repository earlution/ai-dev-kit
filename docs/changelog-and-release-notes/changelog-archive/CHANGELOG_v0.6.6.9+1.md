## Technical Details

### Prioritization Results

**Critical Priority:**
1. Hash Verification Implementation (SHA-256) - Security requirement
2. Package Builder Script - Foundation for all Phase 3 functionality

**High Priority:**
3. GitHub Releases Integration - Primary distribution mechanism
4. MANIFEST.json Generation - Package metadata essential
5. CLI Tool Package Backend - User experience automation

**Medium Priority:**
6. Package Update Mechanisms - Maintenance enhancement
7. Package Registry (Optional) - Future enhancement
8. OWASP Dependency-Check Integration - Security enhancement

**Low Priority:**
9. Package Signing (PGP/GPG) - Future security enhancement
10. Zip Format Support - Optional Windows convenience

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 3.1: Foundation (Critical Path)**
- Package Builder Script (2-3 days)
- Hash Verification (1-2 days)

**Phase 3.2: Distribution (High Priority)**
- GitHub Releases Integration (0.5-1 day)

**Phase 3.3: Installation (High Priority)**
- Manual Installation Documentation (0.5-1 day)
- CLI Tool Package Backend (3-5 days, after Phase 2)

**Total Phase 3 Effort:** 7-12 days

### Quick Wins

1. **Package Builder Script** - Foundation (2-3 days, can start immediately)
2. **Hash Verification** - Security critical (1-2 days, parallel or after builder)
3. **GitHub Releases Integration** - Distribution (0.5-1 day, after builder)
4. **Manual Installation Documentation** - Usability (0.5-1 day, after distribution)
