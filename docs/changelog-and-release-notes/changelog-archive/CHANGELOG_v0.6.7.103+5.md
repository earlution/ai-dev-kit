## Summary

E6:S07:T103: Doc-init validator update to allow required version file changes during BUILD=0 runs.

---

## Changes

### Doc-init Validation

- Doc-init build validation (`BUILD=0`) now tolerates the configured version file (`rw-config.yaml: version_file` or default `src/fynd_deals/version.py`) as an allowed non-documentation change.
- This unblocks minimal-step doc-init task commits that require updating the internal version coordinate to `+0`.
