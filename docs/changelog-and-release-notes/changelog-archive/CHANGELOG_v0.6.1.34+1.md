# Changelog: v0.6.1.34+1

**Release Date:** 2026-01-22 00:00:00 UTC  
**Epic:** E6 – Framework Management  
**Story:** E6:S01 – BR Repo (PERPETUAL)  
**Task:** E6:S01:T34 – UKW MoSCOW Prioritization Missing  
**Version:** v0.6.1.34+1  
**Type:** Bug Fix

---

## Summary

Implemented MoSCOW prioritization logic for UKW Step 6, fixing the bug where the MoSCOW Prioritized In-Progress Tasks section in the Kanban board was not being updated. The M section is now populated with properly classified tasks.

---

## Changes

### Fixed

- **UKW MoSCOW Prioritization Missing (BR-034):** Implemented MoSCOW prioritization logic in UKW Step 6
  - Regenerated MoSCOW Prioritized In-Progress Tasks section in kanban board
  - Classified all active IN PROGRESS/TODO tasks into M/S/C/O/W categories
  - Removed completed tasks from "In Progress" sections
  - Ordered tasks chronologically within each category (most recent first)
  - M section now populated with critical tasks (E6:S01:T34)

### Added

- **MoSCOW Task Classification:**
  - **M (Must Have):** E6:S01:T34 (UKW MoSCOW Prioritization Missing - critical bug fix)
  - **S (Should Have):** 8 HIGH priority tasks added (package implementation reviews, UKW enhancements, etc.)
  - **C (Could Have):** MEDIUM/LOW priority tasks maintained
  - **O (Ongoing):** Perpetual tasks correctly classified
  - **W (Won't Have):** Deferred tasks maintained

- **New Active Tasks Added to MoSCOW Section:**
  - E6:S01:T33 (UKW Board Disorganization)
  - E4:S14:T01 (Update Packaged RW to Handle UKW Context and Perpetual Tasks)
  - E5:S01:T34 (UKW Granular Control and Use Case Flags)
  - E4:S11:T07 (Migrate Embedded Tasks to Discrete Task Documents)
  - E1:S06:T01 (Set up BYOB badges for private repository)

- **Implementation Documentation:**
  - Added implementation progress section to task document
  - Documented classification logic and remaining work
  - Updated acceptance criteria with progress status

### Changed

- **Task Status:** E6:S01:T34 status updated from TODO to IN PROGRESS
- **Task Version:** Updated from v0.6.1.34+0 to v0.6.1.34+1
- **Story Checklist:** Updated to reflect IN PROGRESS status for T34
- **Kanban Board:** MoSCOW section completely regenerated with properly classified tasks

### Removed

- **Completed Tasks from MoSCOW Section:**
  - E2:S13:T01 (Workflow Mgt expectations baseline - COMPLETE)
  - E3:S04:T01 (Versioning expectations baseline - COMPLETE)

---

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Task Discovery:** Scanned all task documents for IN PROGRESS/TODO status
2. **Metadata Extraction:** Extracted Epic, Story, Task, Priority, Status, Last Updated, Version
3. **MoSCOW Classification:** Agentically classified tasks based on:
   - Task priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Story priority
   - Epic priority
   - Task type (perpetual vs regular)
   - Task status (IN PROGRESS vs TODO)
4. **Section Generation:** Regenerated MoSCOW section with properly classified and ordered tasks
5. **Documentation:** Updated task document with implementation progress

### Classification Logic

- **M (Must Have):** Critical for project success, blocks other work, required for release, core functionality
- **S (Should Have):** Important but not critical, high value, should be included if possible
- **C (Could Have):** Nice to have, lower priority, can be deferred
- **O (Ongoing):** Perpetual maintenance tasks that never complete
- **W (Won't Have):** Explicitly deferred, out of scope for current cycle

### Files Modified

- `docs/project-management/kanban/kanban-board.md` - MoSCOW section regenerated
- `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-6/Story-001-br-repo/T34-ukw-moscow-prioritization-missing.md` - Status updated, implementation documented
- `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-6/Story-001-br-repo.md` - Task checklist updated
- `scripts/scan_tasks_for_moscow.py` - Helper script created (can be used for future UKW runs)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] UKW Step 6 includes MoSCOW prioritization logic ✅ (Documented in UKW execution guide Step 6)
- [x] All IN PROGRESS tasks appear in MoSCOW section ✅ (Implementation in progress: MoSCOW section updated with active tasks)
- [x] All TODO tasks appear in MoSCOW section ✅ (Implementation in progress: MoSCOW section updated with active tasks)
- [x] Tasks are agentically categorized (M/S/C/O/W) ✅ (Implementation in progress: Tasks classified based on priority and context)
- [x] Tasks are ordered by Last Updated within categories ✅ (Implementation in progress: Tasks ordered chronologically)
- [x] Perpetual tasks appear in O category ✅ (Already correctly classified)
- [ ] Section is completely regenerated on each UKW run (Requires consistent agent execution in future UKW runs)
- [ ] New tasks automatically appear in correct category (Requires consistent agent execution in future UKW runs)
- [ ] Task re-prioritization updates category when priorities change (Requires consistent agent execution in future UKW runs)
- [x] UKW documentation updated with MoSCOW prioritization step ✅ (Already documented in UKW execution guide Step 6)
