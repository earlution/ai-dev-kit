## Technical Details

### MoSCOW Classification Logic

Tasks classified using agentic prioritization based on:
- Epic priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Story priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Task priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Task status (IN PROGRESS vs TODO)
- Task type (perpetual vs regular)

**Categories:**
- **M (Must Have):** Critical blocking tasks (currently none)
- **S (Should Have):** Important HIGH priority tasks
- **C (Could Have):** Nice-to-have MEDIUM/LOW priority tasks
- **O (Ongoing):** Perpetual maintenance tasks
- **W (Won't Have):** Explicitly deferred tasks

---

## Impact

- **Kanban Board:** MoSCOW section now accurately reflects current active work
- **Visibility:** Completed tasks removed, current priorities clearly visible
- **UKW Workflow:** Step 6 MoSCOW prioritization logic successfully executed
