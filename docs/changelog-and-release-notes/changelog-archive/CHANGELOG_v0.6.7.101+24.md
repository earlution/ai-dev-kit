## Notes

This release represents kanban documentation synchronization through the Update Kanban Workflow (UKW). UKW is a perpetual maintenance workflow that:

- Synchronizes kanban documentation across the hierarchy (Tasks → Stories → Epics → Board)
- Updates status, priorities, and references based on recent activity
- Maintains consistency across all kanban documents
- Refreshes MoSCOW prioritized tasks to reflect current workstreams

UKW can be triggered manually (via "UKW" command), automatically after manual work, or periodically for comprehensive sync.

**RC Review Planning:**
- Complete RC review structure now tracked in Kanban
- All framework packages have implementation review and installation evaluation stories
- MoSCOW prioritization reflects RC readiness workstreams

**Next Steps:**
- Continue RC review work for Kanban framework (E4:S16, E4:S17)
- Proceed with RC reviews for other framework packages
- Maintain MoSCOW prioritization as work progresses
