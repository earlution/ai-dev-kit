## Notes

This release represents kanban documentation synchronization through the Update Kanban Workflow (UKW). UKW is a perpetual maintenance workflow that:

- Synchronizes kanban documentation across the hierarchy (Tasks → Stories → Epics → Board)
- Updates status, priorities, and references based on recent activity
- Maintains consistency across all kanban documents
- Identifies and documents gaps (e.g., BR-034 for missing MoSCOW prioritization)

UKW can be triggered manually (via "UKW" command), automatically after manual work, or periodically for comprehensive sync.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement MoSCOW prioritization logic in UKW Step 6 (BR-034)
- Ensure all IN PROGRESS/TODO tasks appear in MoSCOW section
- Agentically determine MoSCOW category based on priorities
