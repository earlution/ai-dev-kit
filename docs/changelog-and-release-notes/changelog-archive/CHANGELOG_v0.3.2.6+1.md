**Type:** 🔧 Process Improvement

## Summary

🔧 Process Improvement: Investigated and hardened changelog ordering process to prevent canonical ordering violations

## Changes

### Root Cause Analysis
- Identified that RW Step 4 (Update Main Changelog) used chronological insertion instead of canonical ordering
- Documented exact sequence that led to incorrect ordering (v0.3.2.4+1 before v0.2.4.9+3)
- Created comprehensive investigation report documenting root cause and process gaps

### Process Improvements
- **RW Step 4 Updated:** Added canonical ordering logic requiring version number comparison before insertion
- **Validation Added:** Enhanced `validate_changelog_format.py` with canonical ordering validation
- **RW Step 8 Updated:** Added changelog ordering validation to validator checklist
- **Documentation Updated:** Updated RW execution guide with explicit canonical ordering requirements

### Files Modified

- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_changelog_format.py` - Added ordering validation
- `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/changelog-ordering-investigation-report.md` - Root cause analysis document

### Changelog Reordering
- Comprehensively reordered all 84 changelog entries by canonical version number
- All Epic 2 entries now correctly appear before Epic 3 entries
