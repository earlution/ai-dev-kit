  - *Mitigation:* Implement archival policies; monitor log sizes

### Operational Risks
- **Training Overhead:** Team needs to learn new workflow
  - *Mitigation:* Comprehensive documentation; phased rollout
- **Maintenance Burden:** Additional operational complexity
  - *Mitigation:* Automation wherever possible; clear procedures

### Schedule Risks
- **Integration Delays:** RW and CI dependencies cause slippage
  - *Mitigation:* Early integration testing; contingency buffers
- **Testing Bottlenecks:** Test automation issues delay validation
  - *Mitigation:* Parallel test development; resource allocation
- **Review Cycles:** Documentation and code reviews extend timeline
  - *Mitigation:* Dedicated review time; streamlined processes
