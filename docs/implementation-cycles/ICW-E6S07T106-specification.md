## Executive Summary

This specification defines the migration strategy for converting existing .cursorrules content to Windsurf/Cascade equivalent workflows. The migration will map key policies, workflows, and system instructions from the .cursorrules format to Windsurf-compatible workflow definitions, ensuring continuity of development practices while adapting to the new environment.

name: "Workflow Name"
description: "Workflow description"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "AI Dev Kit"

triggers:
  - type: "command"

  dependencies: ["dependency1", "dependency2"]
  conflicts: ["conflict1", "conflict2"]
```

### Mapping Logic

#### Rule-to-Workflow Mapping
```python
class RuleToWorkflowMapper:
    def map_rw_trigger_section(self, cursorrules_content):
        """Map RW trigger section to Windsurf workflow"""
        return {
            "name": "Release Workflow Trigger",
            "triggers": [
                {
                    "type": "command",
                    "pattern": "RW",
                    "description": "Full Release Workflow"
                },
                {
                    "type": "command", 
                    "pattern": "RW -d",
                    "description": "Documentation-Only Release"
                },
                {
                    "type": "command",
                    "pattern": "RW -k", 
                    "description": "Kanban Documentation Commit"
                }
            ],
            "steps": self.extract_rw_steps(cursorrules_content)
        }
    
    def map_development_guidelines(self, cursorrules_content):
        """Map development guidelines to workflow"""
        return {
            "name": "Development Guidelines",
            "triggers": [
                {
                    "type": "file_event",
                    "pattern": "*.py",
                    "description": "Python file changes"
                }
            ],
            "steps": self.extract_dev_steps(cursorrules_content)
        }
```

#### Instruction Conversion
```python
class InstructionConverter:
    def convert_cursorrules_instruction(self, instruction):
        """Convert .cursorrules instruction to Cascade format"""
        conversion_map = {
            "When the user types": "triggers:",
            "execute the": "action:",
            "as an intelligent agent": "agent_role: intelligent",
            "MUST": "validation: required",
            "CRITICAL": "priority: critical"
        }
        
        converted = instruction
        for old_pattern, new_pattern in conversion_map.items():
            converted = converted.replace(old_pattern, new_pattern)
        
        return converted
```

windsurf.register_workflow("development-guidelines", dev_workflow)
windsurf.register_workflow("documentation-standards", doc_workflow)
```

**Trigger System:**
```python
# Configure trigger detection
trigger_system.add_pattern("RW", "release-workflow")
trigger_system.add_pattern("RW -d", "release-workflow-docs-only")
trigger_system.add_pattern("development", "development-guidelines")
```

### Cascade Integration

**Agent Configuration:**
```python
# Configure Cascade agents for workflow execution
cascade_agent.configure_workflow("release-workflow", {
    "agent_type": "release_agent",
    "capabilities": ["version_bump", "changelog_generation", "git_operations"]
})
```

- Rollback: Simplified workflow alternatives

**Integration Failures**
- Risk: Windsurf/Cascade integration issues
- Mitigation: Incremental integration testing
- Rollback: Standalone workflow execution

### Mitigation Strategies

**Validation Framework**
- Automated semantic equivalence testing
- Side-by-side comparison of rule execution
- User validation of workflow behavior

**Incremental Migration**
