# ICW-E2S01T17-Implementation-Plan: FR-077 IPW-built Task Status Transition and Kboard Sync

**Task:** E2:S01:T17  
**Related FR:** FR-077  
**Host Task:** [T17-ipw-built-task-status-transition-and-kboard-sync-fr077.md](../project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-2/Story-001-rw-agent-execution-and-docs/T17-ipw-built-task-status-transition-and-kboard-sync-fr077.md)  
**Created:** 2026-04-09

---

## Build Plan

1. Define lifecycle policy surface

   - Codify explicit transition conditions for `TODO`, `IN PROGRESS`, and `COMPLETE`.
   - Anchor policy in RW/IPW governance docs with clear ownership statements.

2. Add IPW transition intent contract

   - Extend IPW artifact guidance with status-transition intent/checklist fields.
   - Clarify how implementation sessions consume this intent.

3. Define synchronization ownership

   - Specify authoritative workflow step(s) for propagating task status to kboard and related board views.
   - Ensure no ambiguous overlap between IPW, implementation flow, and RW/UKW.

4. Implement drift-detection mechanism

   - Add validator/audit logic or checklist path to detect implemented-but-TODO mismatches.
   - Ensure deterministic, actionable diagnostics.

5. Integrate and validate

   - Validate policy/docs/tooling coherence with scenario matrix.
   - Confirm atomic update expectation is represented in process and tests.

6. Final hardening

   - Document rollback strategy for over-aggressive transition behavior.
   - Ensure migration notes for existing tasks with stale states.

## Integration Touchpoints

- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/implementation-planning-workflow-agent-execution.md`
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/docs/documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
- `docs/project-management/kanban/kanban-board.md`
- `docs/project-management/kanban/fr-br-uxr-board.md`
- Existing validation/audit scripts in `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/`

---

## Rollback and Recovery

- Introduce transition enforcement in staged increments with clear fallback behavior.
- Preserve manual override guidance for ambiguous evidence conditions.
- If false positives occur, revert to previous non-enforcing mode while retaining audit reporting.

---

## Exit Criteria

- FR-077 AC-1 through AC-4 are mapped to implemented behavior and verification evidence.
- Transition ownership and timing are consistent across IPW/RW/UKW docs.
- Drift detection reliably reports stale TODO states after implementation evidence.
- Atomic task-doc/kboard synchronization requirement is operationalized.

---

## Evidence Checklist

- [ ] Transition contract published and linked from relevant workflow docs.
- [ ] IPW transition intent/checklist integrated and documented.
- [ ] Synchronization ownership and timing documented without contradictions.
- [ ] Drift detection check implemented and tested.
- [ ] Regression scenarios pass for planning-only, implementation-start, and completion states.

## Handoff Notes

Use this ICW package as the implementation planning source of truth for FR-077. Keep FR/task/story wiring synchronized in each change set and capture edge-case policy decisions directly in task notes prior to release.
