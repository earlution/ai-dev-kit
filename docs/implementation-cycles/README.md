# Implementation cycles (`docs/implementation-cycles/`)

This directory holds **durable** planning outputs: ICW-style **specifications**, **test designs**, **implementation plans**, and related summaries linked from Kanban **tasks**.

## Policy (read this first)

**Where is the “real” spec?** See **[Specification and planning artifacts policy](../architecture/standards-and-adrs/specification-and-planning-artifacts-policy.md)** — task docs and FRs own intent; **IDE-only** plan folders are **not** inventory.

## Naming

Prefer predictable filenames so grep and humans can find work by **E/S/T**:

- `ICW-E{epic}S{story}T{task}-specification.md`
- `ICW-E{epic}S{story}T{task}-test-design.md`
- `ICW-E{epic}S{story}T{task}-implementation-plan.md`

Batch ICW packages may use a range in the basename (e.g. `ICW-E7S06-T10-T16-*`) when one cycle deliberately covers multiple tasks.

## ICW configuration

The Implementation Cycle Workflow declares **`output_dir: docs/implementation-cycles`** in:

`packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/implementation-cycle-workflow/icw-workflow.yaml`

That path is part of **ICW’s responsibility**: persist the three-phase package here (or the adopt project’s configured `output_dir`), link it from the **task doc**, and do **not** rely on editor-local `plans` as the only copy. New automation or agents should **write here**, not only under editor-local `plans` paths.
