# ICW-E2S01T15-Implementation-Plan: FR-049 Canonical RW Step SoT

**Task:** E2:S01:T15  
**Related FR:** FR-049  
**Host Task:** [T15-canonical-rw-step-list-single-source-of-truth-fr049.md](../project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-2/Story-001-rw-agent-execution-and-docs/T15-canonical-rw-step-list-single-source-of-truth-fr049.md)  
**Created:** 2026-04-09

---

## Build Plan

1. Validate `FR-049` and `T15` traceability metadata (`Code`, implementing links, status/version fields).
2. Confirm canonical RW step definition remains the single source of truth.
3. Sweep consumer surfaces for semantic consistency (including Step 13 housekeeping wording).
4. Verify story checklist and task cross-links remain synchronized.
5. Prepare release-ready evidence package for RW execution.

---

## Dependency Notes

- Requires accessible canonical RW step definition and its consumer references.
- Depends on stable `FR-049` and `T15` documents.
- Uses Story 001 checklist as authoritative placement context.

---

## Rollback / Recovery Notes

- If drift is found, reconcile consumer docs/scripts to canonical source first, then re-run consistency checks.
- If cross-links are broken, restore FR <-> Task links before closing planning cycle.
- If release markers are incomplete, reopen task state as needed and correct metadata before RW.

## Validation Checklist (Exit Criteria)

- [ ] `ICW-E2S01T15-specification.md` exists and is `FR-049`/`T15` specific.
- [ ] `ICW-E2S01T15-test-design.md` exists and covers SoT + traceability risks.
- [ ] `ICW-E2S01T15-implementation-plan.md` exists and defines execution + recovery.
- [ ] `T15` task doc links all three artifacts in both `Input` and `Links`.
- [ ] All three artifacts link back to `T15` host task.
- [ ] No residual prior-task identifiers remain in `ICW-E2S01T15-*`.

## Handoff for Implementation Cycle Step 3a/3b

1. Use this package as planning source for TDD-oriented execution.
2. Execute checks in test-design order before implementation changes.
3. Record outcomes against this checklist and update task metadata atomically.
