## Validation Results Summary

### Step 1: Branch Safety Validation
**Result:** ⚠️ **ATTENTION REQUIRED**
- **Current Branch:** main (not epic/{n} format)
- **Working Directory:** MODIFIED (has uncommitted changes)
- **Git Remotes:** ✅ Properly configured
- **Issue:** Branch safety validation will fail

**Recommended Action:** 
- Since we're working on multi-epic tasks (E5, E8, E24), create epic/24-could-have-tasks-release branch
- Commit current changes before proceeding with release
- Or proceed with caution on main branch

### Step 2: Configuration Verification
**Result:** ✅ **VALIDATION PASSED**
- **rw-config.yaml:** ✅ Exists and readable
- **SemVer Strategy:** ✅ Updated to task_touch mode
- **Configuration:** ✅ All required fields present
- **YAML Format:** ✅ Valid configuration

**Configuration Details:**
```yaml
semver_mapping_strategy: task_touch
version_file: src/fynd_deals/version.py
main_changelog: CHANGELOG.md
changelog_dir: docs/changelog-and-release-notes/changelog-archive
```

### Step 3: Dependencies Check
