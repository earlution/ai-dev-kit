**Story:** Story 1 - RW Agent Execution & Docs  
**Task:** Task 5 - Harden RW branch safety checks to stop execution on wrong branch  
**Build:** 1

---

## Summary

Hardened Release Workflow Step 1 (Branch Safety Check) to be a mandatory blocking step that prevents cross-epic contamination. The workflow now stops immediately if branch/version/epic alignment fails, with clear error messages and guidance.

---

## Changes

### 🔒 Workflow Hardening

**Step 1: Branch Safety Check - Now MANDATORY BLOCKING**
- ✅ Made Step 1 a mandatory blocking step that cannot be skipped
- ✅ Requires execution of `validate_branch_context.py --strict` before any file modifications
- ✅ Stops workflow immediately if validator returns non-zero exit code
- ✅ Marks all remaining steps as `cancelled` on failure
- ✅ Provides clear error messages with actionable guidance

**Updated Documentation:**
- ✅ Updated `release-workflow-agent-execution.md` with mandatory enforcement requirements
- ✅ Updated `cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md` with branch safety emphasis
- ✅ Updated `release-workflow-reference.md` to reflect Step 1 as Branch Safety Check
- ✅ Updated `release-workflow.yaml` with mandatory/blocking flags

**Integration:**
- ✅ Validator integration pattern documented with code examples
- ✅ Error message format standardized
- ✅ Anti-patterns documented (what not to do)

---

## Files Modified

- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/docs/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md`
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/docs/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-reference.md`
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/release-workflow.yaml`
- `src/fynd_deals/version.py`

---

## Problem Solved

**Before:** Release Workflow continued execution even when on wrong branch (e.g., on `epic/9` but committing Epic 5 work), allowing cross-epic contamination.

**After:** Release Workflow stops immediately if branch safety check fails, preventing any file modifications and providing clear guidance to switch to the correct branch.

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ RW stops immediately if branch safety check fails
- ✅ No file modifications occur when on wrong branch
- ✅ Clear error messages guide user to correct branch
- ✅ All remaining steps marked as `cancelled` on failure
- ✅ Agent cannot bypass branch safety checks
- ✅ Validator integration is mandatory and non-optional

## Notes

This release hardens the Release Workflow's branch safety enforcement, making Step 1 a mandatory blocking step that prevents cross-epic contamination. The workflow now enforces branch isolation principles more rigorously, improving overall reliability and preventing accidental commits on wrong branches.
