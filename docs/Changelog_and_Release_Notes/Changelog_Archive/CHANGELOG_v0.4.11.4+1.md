# Release v0.4.11.4+1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-11 00:00:00 UTC

**Epic / Story / Task:** Epic 4, Story 11, Task 4
**Type:** 📋 Policy Update

## Summary

Defined abstract space concept for zero-numbered E/S/T documentation across all Kanban and Versioning policies. This establishes the canonical version anchor for forensic traceability before any functional work is committed, implementing FR-018.

## Changes

### Updated

- **Kanban Governance Policy (Canonical):** `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`
  - Added "Abstract Spaces for Forensic Traceability" section after Versioning section
  - Defined zero-numbered E/S/T documentation as abstract space concept
  - Added Epic-level (`0.{EPIC}.0.0+0`), Story-level (`0.{EPIC}.{STORY}.0+0`), Task-level (`0.{EPIC}.{STORY}.{TASK}+0`) abstract spaces
  - Added SOP for committing initial E/S/T docs (when, where, how)
  - Explained relationship between abstract space (`+0`) and functional work (`+1`)
  - Cross-referenced Numbering Policy

- **Kanban Governance Policy (Dev-Kit Local):** `docs/Project_Management/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md`
  - Added "Abstract Spaces for Forensic Traceability" section (5.5)
  - Added zero-numbered E/S/T documentation definition
  - Added abstract space examples for Epic, Story, and Task levels
  - Added SOP for committing initial E/S/T docs
  - Cross-referenced Dev-Kit Versioning Policy

- **Framework Versioning Policy:** `packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/versioning-policy.md`
  - Added "Abstract Space Version Schema" section after Task Document Requirements
  - Added Epic-level, Story-level, and Task-level abstract space definitions
  - Added examples for each level:
    - Epic: `0.3.0.0+0`, `0.10.0.0+0`, `0.21.0.0+0`
    - Story: `0.2.5.0+0`, `0.4.11.0+0`, `0.10.3.0+0`
    - Task: `0.10.4.6+0`, `0.4.11.1+0`, `0.2.9.3+0`
  - Explained relationship between abstract space (`+0`) and functional work (`+1`)
  - Added validation requirements
  - Cross-referenced Kanban Governance Policy

- **Dev-Kit Versioning Policy:** `docs/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/dev-kit-versioning-policy.md`
  - Added "Abstract Space Version Schema" subsection (6.2) after Task Transitions
  - Added Epic-level, Story-level, and Task-level abstract space definitions
  - Added examples for each level
  - Added SOP for committing initial E/S/T docs

## Notes

This release completes the abstract space definition across all policy documents. The abstract space concept:

1. **Establishes canonical anchor:** `+0` build number indicates documentation-only anchor
2. **Begins traceability arc:** Forensic traceability starts at documentation creation, not first functional work
3. **Provides clear SOP:** When, where, and how to commit initial E/S/T documentation
4. **Links policies:** Kanban and Versioning policies now consistently define abstract spaces
5. **Supports FR-017:** Abstract space concept is prerequisite for doc-init build `+0` implementation

All four policy documents (canonical Kanban, dev-kit Kanban, framework Versioning, dev-kit Versioning) now consistently define:
- Epic-level abstract spaces: `0.{EPIC}.0.0+0`
- Story-level abstract spaces: `0.{EPIC}.{STORY}.0+0`
- Task-level abstract spaces: `0.{EPIC}.{STORY}.{TASK}+0`
- Relationship between abstract space (`+0`) and functional work (`+1`)
- SOP for committing initial E/S/T docs

This provides the foundation for FR-017 implementation (doc-init build `+0`).
