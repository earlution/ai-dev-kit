## DO Phase

### Changes Made

1. **Expanded Epic 4 Story 1 to Comprehensive Architecture Design Specification**
   - Expanded from 6 tasks to 11 comprehensive tasks
   - Now forms the backbone and abstract plan for the design phase
   - Includes complete software engineering process:
     - **T01: Requirements Engineering** - Functional/non-functional requirements, prioritization, traceability matrix
     - **T02: Use Case Modelling** - Actors, use cases, UML diagrams, use case specifications
     - **T03: Domain Analysis and Noun-Verb Analysis** - Entity-verb analysis, domain model, bounded contexts, domain vocabulary
     - **T04: Top-Down High-Level System View** - System context, boundaries, subsystems, architecture diagrams
     - **T05: Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** - Level 0, 1, 2+ DFDs with data flows, stores, and processes
     - **T06: UML Design Models** - Class, sequence, state, component, deployment, activity diagrams
     - **T07: Object and Interface Specifications** - SOLID principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP), contracts, interfaces, pre/post conditions
     - **T08: Architecture Patterns and Design Decisions** - Patterns, ADRs, design rationale, constraints
     - **T09: Integration Points and System Boundaries** - Subsystem integration, external interfaces, protocols
     - **T10: Design Validation and Review** - Traceability, SOLID validation, stakeholder review
     - **T11: Design Documentation and Deliverables** - Complete specification document, implementation-ready deliverables
   - Goal: Any competent programmer/vibe-coder should be able to implement a system that satisfies requirements using the output from E4S01
   - All tasks follow SOLID software engineering principles

## CHECK Phase

### Validation

- ✅ Branch context validation passed
- ✅ Version bump completed (0.6.6.6+10 → 0.6.6.6+11)
- ✅ Epic 4 Story 1 expanded to comprehensive architecture design specification
- ✅ All 11 tasks include SOLID principles and standard software engineering practices

### Files Modified

- `src/fynd_deals/version.py` - Version bumped to 0.6.6.6+11
- `docs/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/ultimate-canonical-kanban-structure-revised-proposal.md` - Expanded E4S01

### Files Created

- `docs/Changelog_and_Release_Notes/Changelog_Archive/CHANGELOG_v0.6.6.6+11.md` - This changelog

## ACT Phase

### Next Steps

1. Update main changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`)
2. Update README version badge
3. Auto-update Kanban docs (Epic 6, Story 6)
4. Stage all modified files
5. Run validators
6. Commit changes
7. Create git tag
8. Push to remote

## Summary

This release expands Epic 4 Story 1 from a thin architecture design to a comprehensive architecture design specification that forms the backbone and abstract plan for the design phase. The story now includes 11 tasks covering the complete software engineering process: requirements engineering, use case modelling, domain analysis, DFDs, UML models, SOLID-based object specifications, architecture patterns, integration points, validation, and complete documentation. The output should enable any competent programmer to implement the system from the E4S01 deliverables.
