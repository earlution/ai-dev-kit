## DO Phase

### Changes Made

1. **Revised Canonical Kanban Structure Proposal**
   - Created `docs/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/ultimate-canonical-kanban-structure-revised-proposal.md`
   - Reorganized epics into clearer phases:
     - **Pre-Design Phase (E1):** Project foundation, workflow management, versioning, Kanban setup
     - **Design Phase (E2-E8):** Architecture, data, testing, implementation, documentation
     - **Ancillary Epics (E9+):** CI/CD, security, and project-specific epics
   - Key changes:
     - E1 consolidates pre-design work (old E1+E2+E3+E4)
     - E2 becomes Architecture Design (new + architecture refactoring from old E22)
     - E3 consolidates FR/BR/UXR (old E5+E6+E7)
     - E4 is Data Management (old E10)
     - E5 is Testing/QA (old E13) - TDD approach after architecture
     - E6 is Implementation (includes old E8 + implementation refactoring + PIR story)
     - E7 is Documentation (old E18)
     - E8 is CI/CD (old E23)
     - E9 is Security (old E15, enhanced with Dependabot/project security)
   - Includes questions for clarification on epic numbering and scope
