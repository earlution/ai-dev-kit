## Notes

This release implements the policy foundation for FR-016. All three policy documents now consistently mandate:
- Explicit 3-tier structure (Epic → Story → Task)
- Discrete Task documents (or clearly delimited sections)
- Required Task document fields
- Prohibition of implicit/inline tasks
- Validation requirements for Task doc presence

The next task (T02) will create the Task document template and update the Story template to support these requirements.
