### Key Documentation Points

**Copy vs Reference Pattern:**
- ✅ **Copy, don't reference:** Projects must copy files, not link to `ai-dev-kit`
- ✅ **Why copy:** Independence, customization, control, stability
- ✅ **What to copy:** Core policies, templates, validation scripts

**Customization Boundaries:**
- ✅ **CAN customize:** Epic ranges, file paths, project names, terminology
- ❌ **MUST keep:** Schema format, validation rules, core principles, date formats

**Update Process:**
- ✅ Monitor framework for updates
- ✅ Review changes selectively
- ✅ Adopt relevant patterns while preserving customizations

**SoT Relationship:**
- ✅ `ai-dev-kit` is canonical source of truth
- ✅ Projects adapt framework for their context
- ✅ Projects reference framework as source in documentation

## 📝 Notes

The consumption pattern documentation clarifies how other projects should consume the versioning framework. The critical rule is that projects MUST copy framework files (not reference them), allowing for customization while maintaining alignment with the canonical source of truth.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **T006:** Make .cursorrules abstract (remove hardcoded version numbers)
