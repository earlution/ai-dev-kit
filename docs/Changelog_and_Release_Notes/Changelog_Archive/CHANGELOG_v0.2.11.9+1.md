## Summary

Completed E2:S11:T09 by updating workflow-mgt documentation to include comprehensive references to the Intake Workflow. Added intake workflow to README, trigger-aware RW documentation, and agent-driven workflow execution guide as a canonical example. All documentation now properly cross-references the intake workflow execution guide and workflow definition.
