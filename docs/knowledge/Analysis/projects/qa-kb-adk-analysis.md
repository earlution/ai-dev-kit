## 1. Kanban Structure Analysis

### 1.1 Structure Overview

- **Epic Count:** 1 epic (Epic 10)
- **Story Count:** 5 stories
- **Task Count:** Multiple tasks per story
- **Directory Structure:** `docs/Epic-10.md` and `docs/epic-10-legacy/` (not in docs/Project_Management/)
- **File Organization:** Flat structure (docs/ directory)

**Epic Inventory:**
- Epic 10: Knowledge Services Platform (Problem-Solution KB) ✅ (project-specific, migrated from dev-toolkit)
- **NO Epic 9** ✅ **NO MASHUP**

### 1.2 Distance from ADK Canonical Structure

**Comparison to ADK Canonical:**

**Epic Structure:** ✅ **NO MASHUP - ALL PROJECT-SPECIFIC**
- **Epic 10:** Project-specific epic (migrated from dev-toolkit)
- **NO Epic 9:** No "Book Related Work" epic
- **No Framework Epics:** No Epics 1-9 from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure
- **Good:** Project has its own epic structure, no confusion

**Epic Naming:** ⚠️ **DIVERGES**
- Uses "Epic-10" (with hyphen) which matches ADK canonical
- But structure is in `docs/` not `docs/Project_Management/kanban/epics/`
- **Difference:** Different root path
- **Impact:** Major - different structure location

**Story Structure:** ✅ **MATCHES** (mostly)
- Stories organized in docs/ directory
- Story naming follows pattern: `Story-001-problem-solution-kb-foundation.md`
- Story documents include proper structure

**Task Structure:** ⚠️ **DIVERGES**
- Tasks appear to be embedded in Story documents (not separate files)
- Task naming: `T00`, `T01`, etc. (embedded in stories)
- **Difference:** Tasks not in separate files/directories
- **Impact:** Minor - different organization pattern

**Naming Conventions:** ✅ **MATCHES**
- Epic naming: `Epic-10.md` (hyphen format) ✅
- Story naming: `Story-001-Description.md` (3-digit format) ✅
- Task naming: Embedded in stories vs separate files

**File Organization:** ⚠️ **MAJOR DIVERGENCE**
- Structure: `docs/Epic-10.md` and `docs/Story-001-Description.md` (flat structure)
- **Difference:** Uses `docs/` instead of `docs/Project_Management/kanban/epics/`
- **Impact:** Major - completely different structure location

**Drift Assessment:**
- **Severity:** **MAJOR** (different structure location, but no mashup)
- **Root Cause:** Migrated project, minimal structure appropriate for spin-off
- **Impact:** Major - incompatible with ADK tools expecting docs/Project_Management/kanban/ structure

### 1.3 Good Practices

✅ **What Works Well:**

1. **NO Epic Mashup**
   - Epic 10 is project-specific (migrated from dev-toolkit)
   - No Epic 9 "Book Related Work"
   - Clear project boundaries

2. **Good Story Organization**
   - Stories well-organized
   - Clear story naming (Story-001 format)
   - Good story documentation

3. **Migration Documentation**
   - Good migration documentation (epic-10-legacy/ directory)
   - Clear migration history
   - Proper documentation of migration

### 1.4 Bad Practices

❌ **What Doesn't Work:**

1. **Different Structure Location**
   - **Issue:** Uses `docs/` instead of `docs/Project_Management/kanban/epics/`
   - **Problem:** Incompatible with ADK tools expecting KB structure
   - **Impact:** Major - can't use ADK tools directly

2. **Task Organization**
   - **Issue:** Tasks embedded in Story documents instead of separate files
   - **Problem:** Less granular tracking
   - **Impact:** Minor - works but less flexible

### 1.5 Mashup Issues

🔀 **Mixing ADK Components:**

**None Identified** - No mashup issues found. Epic 10 is project-specific (migrated from dev-toolkit).

### 1.6 Recommendations

**For This Project:**
1. **Consider KB Structure Migration** - Evaluate migrating to `docs/Project_Management/kanban/epics/` structure
2. **Task Organization** - Consider separating tasks into individual files for better granularity
3. **None Otherwise** - Epic structure is correct, no mashup

**For ADK:**
1. **Support Different Structure Locations**
   - ADK should support projects with different structure locations
   - Support both `docs/` and `docs/Project_Management/kanban/epics/` paths
   - Make tools path-configurable

2. **Support Migrated Projects**
   - Document migration patterns
   - Provide migration guidance
   - Support gradual adoption

## 5. Framework Drift Analysis

### 5.1 Drift Summary

**Overall Drift Level:** **MAJOR** (migrated project, minimal structure, no versioning)

**Areas of Drift:**
- **Kanban:** **MAJOR** (different structure location)
- **KB:** **MAJOR** (no docs/ directory, uses docs/)
- **Workflows:** **MAJOR** (no workflows)
- **Versioning:** **MAJOR** (no versioning)

### 5.2 Root Causes

**Why Drift Occurred:**

1. **Migrated Project**

   - Minimal structure appropriate for spin-off
   - Early-stage project

2. **No ADK Framework Installation**
   - No ADK frameworks as packages
   - No versioning setup

- Migrated projects need minimal structure
- Early-stage projects need simple setup
- Spin-off projects need different structure

### 5.3 Impact Assessment

**Problems Caused:**

1. **Incompatible with ADK Tools**
   - Different structure location incompatible with ADK tools
   - No versioning incompatible with ADK tools
   - No RW workflow incompatible with ADK framework

2. **But Works Well**
   - Current structure works well for migrated project
   - Minimal structure appropriate
   - Good migration documentation

**Maintenance Burden:**
