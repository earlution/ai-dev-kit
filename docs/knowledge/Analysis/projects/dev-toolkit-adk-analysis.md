---

## 1. Kanban Structure Analysis

### 1.1 Structure Overview

- **Epic Count:** 23 epics (Epics 1-9, 18, 22, 23)
- **Story Count:** ~100+ stories across epics
- **Task Count:** Multiple tasks per story
- **Directory Structure:** `docs/Project_Management/kanban/epics/Epic-X/`
- **File Organization:** Nested (Epic → Story → Task directories)

**Epic Inventory:**
- **Epics 1-9:** Framework epics from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure ❌ **MASHUP**
- **Epic 9:** "Book Related Work" ❌ **INAPPROPRIATE FOR TOOLKIT PROJECT**
- **Epic 18:** Documentation (project-specific or canonical?)
- **Epic 22:** Architecture Refactoring and Code Quality (project-specific or canonical?)
- **Epic 23:** Process Automation and CI/CD (project-specific or canonical?)
- **Epic 10:** Migrated out (see EPIC-10-MIGRATION-NOTE.md)

### 1.2 Distance from ADK Canonical Structure

**Comparison to ADK Canonical:**

**Epic Structure:** ❌ **CRITICAL MASHUP ISSUE**
- **Epics 1-9:** Framework epics from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure (dev-kit repo)
  - Epic 1: AI Dev Kit Core (but also has project-specific stories!)
  - Epic 2: Workflow Management Framework
  - Epic 3: Numbering & Versioning Framework
  - Epic 4: Kanban Framework
  - Epic 5: Documentation Management and Maintenance
  - Epic 6: Framework Management and Maintenance
  - Epic 7: Codebase Maintenance and Review
  - Epic 8: Tooling & Automation
  - **Epic 9: Book Related Work** ❌ **INAPPROPRIATE FOR TOOLKIT PROJECT**
- **Epics 18, 22, 23:** May be canonical epics (need to verify)

**Root Cause:** Project copied ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure instead of using Kanban package template

**Impact:** 
- Confusion about which epics are relevant
- Epic 9 "Book Related Work" has no relevance to toolkit project
- Clutters Kanban board with framework infrastructure epics
- Makes it unclear what the actual project work is
- Epic 1 has mixed stories (framework + project-specific)

**Story Structure:** ✅ **MATCHES**
- Stories organized under Epic directories
- Story naming follows pattern: `Story-XXX-description.md`
- Story documents include proper frontmatter

**Task Structure:** ✅ **MATCHES**
- Tasks organized in Story subdirectories
- Task documents follow pattern: `Task-YYY-description.md` or `TYYY-description.md`
- Tasks have proper structure and metadata

**Naming Conventions:** ✅ **MATCHES**
- Epic naming: `Epic-X/Epic-X.md`
- Story naming: `Story-XXX-description.md`
- Task naming: `Task-YYY-description.md` or `TYYY-description.md`

**File Organization:** ✅ **MATCHES**
- Nested structure: `epics/Epic-X/Story-XXX/Task-YYY.md`
- Consistent with ADK canonical

**Drift Assessment:**
- **Severity:** **CRITICAL** (mashup issue)
- **Root Cause:** Unclear installation instructions led to mixing ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure with Kanban package template
- **Impact:** Confusion, inappropriate epics, unclear project boundaries, mixed stories in Epic 1

### 1.3 Good Practices

✅ **What Works Well:**

1. **Proper Framework Installation**
   - Frameworks installed via Git submodule in `packages/frameworks/`
   - Clean separation between frameworks and project code
   - Proper framework structure maintained

2. **Correct KB Structure**
   - KB structure matches ADK canonical exactly (`docs/Project_Management/kanban/`)
   - Proper directory organization
   - Good separation of concerns

3. **Proper Version File**
   - Version file at `src/fynd_deals/version.py`
   - Using RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD schema correctly
   - Version tracking integrated with Kanban

4. **RW Configuration**
   - `rw-config.yaml` properly configured
   - Kanban integration enabled
   - Proper path mappings

5. **Workflow Integration**
   - `.cursorrules` includes RW trigger section (11-step with branch safety)
   - `workflows/release-workflow.yaml` present
   - Good integration with Kanban

6. **Epic Migration Handling**
   - Epic 10 properly migrated out (EPIC-10-MIGRATION-NOTE.md)
   - Good documentation of migration

### 1.4 Bad Practices

❌ **What Doesn't Work:**

1. **CRITICAL: Epic Mashup**
   - **Issue:** Epics 1-9 from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure mixed with project
   - **Problem:** Epic 9 "Book Related Work" has no relevance to toolkit project
   - **Impact:** Confusion, clutter, unclear project boundaries
   - **Root Cause:** Unclear distinction between:
     - ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure (for dev-kit repo)
     - Kanban package template (for client projects)

2. **Epic 1 Mixed Stories**
   - **Issue:** Epic 1 has both framework stories (ai-dev-kit setup) and project-specific stories (tool management)
   - **Problem:** Confusion about what Epic 1 represents
   - **Impact:** Unclear project boundaries
   - **Examples:**
     - `Story-001-vibe-dev-kit-kanban-and-versioning.md` (framework story)
     - `Story-001-tool-management-system.md` (project-specific story)
     - `Story-002-package-and-repo-architecture.md` (framework story)
     - `Story-002-tool-distribution-strategy.md` (project-specific story)

3. **Framework Epics in Project Kanban**
   - **Issue:** Epics 1-8 are framework infrastructure epics, not project epics
   - **Problem:** These epics belong to ai-dev-kit repo, not client projects
   - **Impact:** Confusion about what work belongs to the project vs. framework

4. **Inconsistent Epic Usage**
   - **Issue:** Some framework epics (1-8) have stories/tasks, others don't
   - **Problem:** Unclear which epics are active vs. template placeholders
   - **Impact:** Maintenance burden, confusion

### 1.5 Mashup Issues

🔀 **Mixing ADK Components:**

1. **Epic 9 "Book Related Work" in Toolkit Project**
   - **Description:** Epic 9 from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure present in toolkit project
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL - Epic has no relevance to toolkit project
   - **Root Cause:** Project copied ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure instead of using Kanban package template
   - **Evidence:** `docs/Project_Management/kanban/epics/Epic-9/Epic-9.md` exists with "Book Related Work" content

2. **Framework Infrastructure Epics (1-8) in Project**
   - **Description:** Epics 1-8 are framework infrastructure epics from ai-dev-kit repo
   - **Impact:** MAJOR - Confusion about project vs. framework work
   - **Root Cause:** Same as above - copied dev-kit's own structure

3. **Epic 1 Mixed Stories**
   - **Description:** Epic 1 contains both framework stories (ai-dev-kit setup) and project-specific stories (tool management)
   - **Impact:** MAJOR - Confusion about Epic 1's purpose
   - **Root Cause:** Project copied framework epics but also added project-specific stories

### 1.6 Recommendations

**For This Project:**
1. **Remove Epic 9** - "Book Related Work" has no relevance to toolkit project
2. **Evaluate Epics 1-8** - Determine if these are needed or should be removed
3. **Separate Epic 1 Stories** - Separate framework stories from project-specific stories
4. **Clarify Project Boundaries** - Ensure only project-relevant epics remain
5. **Consider Epic Cleanup** - Remove framework infrastructure epics if not needed

**For ADK:**
1. **CRITICAL: Clarify Installation Instructions**
   - Make it CRYSTAL CLEAR that projects should NOT copy ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure
   - Projects should use Kanban package template, not dev-kit's own epics
   - Add explicit warnings about this mashup

2. **Separate Dev-Kit Structure from Package Template**
   - Clearly distinguish between:
     - `ai-dev-kit/docs/Project_Management/kanban/epics/` (dev-kit's own structure)
     - `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/` (package template for projects)
   - Make this distinction obvious in installation guide

3. **Add Installation Validation**
   - Create validator to detect mashup issues
   - Warn if project has inappropriate epics (e.g., Epic 9 in non-book projects)
   - Provide cleanup guidance

4. **Improve Template Contextualization**
   - Template should guide projects to:
     - Use only relevant canonical epics (1-7, 8, 10, 18, 22, 23)
     - Add project-specific epics
     - NOT copy dev-kit's own epics (1-9)

5. **Document Epic 1 Confusion**
   - Epic 1 in dev-kit is "AI Dev Kit Core" (framework epic)
   - Projects should NOT copy this epic
   - Projects should create their own "Project Core" epic if needed

2. **Template Confusion**
   - Project didn't understand difference between:
     - `ai-dev-kit/docs/Project_Management/kanban/epics/` (dev-kit's own structure)
     - `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/` (package template)

3. **Epic 1 Confusion**
   - Epic 1 in dev-kit is "AI Dev Kit Core" (framework epic)
   - Project copied it but also added project-specific stories
   - Created confusion about Epic 1's purpose

**Common Patterns:**
- Epic mashup appears to be common issue (seen in been-there, dev-toolkit)
- Framework epics mixed with project epics
- Epic 1 confusion (framework vs. project)

### 7.3 Impact Assessment

**Problems Caused:**

1. **Confusion**
   - Unclear which epics are project work vs. framework work
   - Epic 9 "Book Related Work" has no relevance
   - Epic 1 has mixed stories

2. **Clutter**
   - Kanban board cluttered with framework infrastructure epics
   - Makes it hard to see actual project work

3. **Maintenance Burden**
   - Framework epics may be maintained unnecessarily
   - Unclear what needs attention
   - Epic 1 stories are mixed

**Maintenance Burden:**
- High - Epic cleanup needed
- Framework epics may be maintained unnecessarily
- Epic 1 needs story separation

   - Create validator to detect inappropriate epics
   - Provide cleanup guidance
   - Separate dev-kit structure from package template more clearly

2. **Clarify Epic 1** (Priority: High)
   - Document that Epic 1 is framework epic, not for projects
   - Projects should create their own "Project Core" epic if needed
   - Add explicit warnings about Epic 1

3. **Add Installation Validation** (Priority: High)
   - Create `validate_kanban_structure.py` script
   - Check for inappropriate epics
   - Warn about framework epics in project Kanban
   - Integrate into installation process

**For This Project:**

1. **Remove Epic 9** - "Book Related Work" has no relevance
2. **Evaluate Epics 1-8** - Determine if needed or should be removed
3. **Separate Epic 1 Stories** - Separate framework stories from project-specific stories
4. **Clarify Project Boundaries** - Ensure only project-relevant epics remain

### 9.3 Patterns Across Projects

**Common Patterns:**
- Epic mashup appears in multiple projects (been-there, dev-toolkit)
- Framework epics mixed with project epics
- Epic 1 confusion (framework vs. project)
- Need for clearer installation guidance
