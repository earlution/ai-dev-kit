## 1. Kanban Structure Analysis

### 1.1 Structure Overview

- **Epic Count:** 6 epics (Epics 1-6)
- **Story Count:** ~20+ stories across epics
- **Task Count:** Multiple tasks per story
- **Directory Structure:** `docs/Project_Management/epics/overview/Epic X/` (with space, not hyphen)
- **File Organization:** Nested (Epic → Story documents)

**Epic Inventory:**

- **NO Epic 9** ✅ **NO MASHUP**

### 1.2 Distance from ADK Canonical Structure

**Comparison to ADK Canonical:**

**Epic Structure:** ✅ **NO MASHUP - ALL PROJECT-SPECIFIC**
- **Epics 1-6:** All project-specific epics (no framework epics from ai-dev-kit)
- **NO Epic 9:** No "Book Related Work" epic
- **No Framework Epics:** No Epics 1-9 from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure
- **Good:** Project has its own epic structure, no confusion

**Epic Naming:** ⚠️ **DIVERGES**
- Uses "Epic 1" (with space) instead of "Epic-1" (with hyphen)
- Directory structure: `Epic 1/` instead of `Epic-1/`
- **Difference:** Space vs hyphen in naming
- **Impact:** Minor - different naming convention, but functional

**Story Structure:** ✅ **MATCHES** (mostly)
- Stories organized under Epic directories
- Story naming follows pattern: `E2S1-Active-Collection-Mechanic.md` (Epic-Story format)
- Story documents include proper structure

**Task Structure:** ⚠️ **DIVERGES**
- Tasks appear to be embedded in Story documents (not separate files)
- Task naming: `S01:T001`, `E03:S01:T001`, etc. (embedded in stories)
- **Difference:** Tasks not in separate files/directories
- **Impact:** Minor - different organization pattern

**Naming Conventions:** ⚠️ **DIVERGES**
- Epic naming: `Epic 1/Epic-1.md` (space in directory, hyphen in file)
- Story naming: `E2S1-Description.md` (Epic-Story format)
- Task naming: Embedded in stories vs separate files

**File Organization:** ⚠️ **DIVERGES**
- Structure: `docs/Project_Management/epics/overview/Epic X/E2S1-Description.md`
- **Difference:** Uses `epics/overview/` instead of `kanban/epics/`
- **Impact:** Minor - different path, but functional

**Drift Assessment:**
- **Severity:** **MINOR** (naming/path differences, but no mashup)
- **Root Cause:** Pre-ADK project or early adopter, evolved its own structure before ADK existed
- **Impact:** Minor - different naming conventions and paths, but functional

   - **Problem:** Inconsistent with ADK canonical path
   - **Impact:** Minor - works but inconsistent

### 1.5 Mashup Issues

🔀 **Mixing ADK Components:**

**None Identified** - No mashup issues found. All epics are project-specific.

### 1.6 Recommendations

**For This Project:**
1. **Consider Epic Naming Migration** - Evaluate migrating to "Epic-1" format for consistency
2. **Task Organization** - Consider separating tasks into individual files for better granularity
