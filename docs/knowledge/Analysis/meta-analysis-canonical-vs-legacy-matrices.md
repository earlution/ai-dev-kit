# Meta-Analysis: Canonical vs Legacy Matrices

**Purpose:** Compare ADK canonical structures to real-world patterns, identifying gaps, over-engineering, and legacy support needs  
**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-17  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Part of:** E6:S06:T06 – Cross-project meta-analysis and canonical framework design

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides **canonical vs legacy matrices** comparing ADK's canonical structures to real-world patterns found across all 9 analyzed projects. This analysis identifies:
- **Gaps:** What's missing in canonical (should be added)
- **Over-engineering:** What's unnecessary in canonical (should be simplified)
- **Legacy patterns:** What needs backward compatibility support
- **Convergence opportunities:** What should become canonical

**Data Sources:**
- ADK canonical structures (from framework packages)
- Real-world patterns (from 10 project analysis reports: 9 client implementations + ai-dev-kit source)
- Pattern frequency tables
- Convergence/divergence maps
