# Debug Path Framework Analysis

**Date:** 2025-12-04  
**Source Project:** fynd.deals  
**Analyst:** AI Agent (Auto)

## 📋 Executive Summary

The **Debug Path Framework (DPF)** and **Debug Round Workflow (DRW)** from `fynd.deals` is a **checklist-driven, multi-phase protocol** for investigating and resolving test failures, regressions, and production bugs. While much of its value has been encapsulated in modern Kanban + agentic workflows, it offers **unique value for simpler scenarios** where full Kanban is overkill, and provides **structured debugging methodology** that could enhance the workflow management framework.

**Key Finding:** DPF/DRW is a **lightweight, focused debugging workflow** that complements (rather than replaces) Kanban. It's ideal for:
- Simple projects that don't need full Kanban structure
- Focused debugging sessions (test failures, regressions)
- Teams wanting structured debugging without Epic/Story overhead
- Agent-driven debugging workflows

---

## 🔍 What is the Debug Path Framework?

### Core Concept

**Debug Paths (DPs)** are structured investigations of **test failures, regressions, or production bugs**. They follow a **6-phase Debug Round Workflow (DRW)**:

1. **Phase 1: Testing** — Execute tests, document results
2. **Phase 2: Analysis** — Analyze failures, root causes
3. **Phase 3: Strategy** — Update plan, hypotheses, approach
4. **Phase 4: Planning** — Implementation steps, success criteria
5. **Phase 5: Implementation** — Code/test changes, rationale
6. **Phase 6: Verification & Archival** — Archive, extract lessons

### Key Characteristics

- **Checklist-driven:** Each phase has explicit checklist items
- **Round-based:** Multiple rounds can be executed iteratively
- **Document-centric:** Multiple documents per debug path (main, analysis, process, tests, strategy, history)
- **Traceable:** Full audit trail with timestamps and round summaries
- **Knowledge-preserving:** Lessons learned extracted and archived

---

## 📐 System Structure

### Document Structure

Each debug path (`DP-XXX`) contains:

1. **`DP-XXX-index.md`** — Canonical entry point (problem, root cause, solution, outcome)
2. **`DP-XXX.md`** — Main debug path document (overview, context snapshot, solution space)
3. **`DP-XXX-process.md`** — Process tracking (checklist, implementation updates, round progress)
4. **`DP-XXX-analysis.md`** — Analysis and validation results
5. **`DP-XXX-tests.md`** — Test execution results
6. **`DP-XXX-strategy.md`** — Strategy evolution, lessons learned
7. **`DP-XXX-history.md`** — Narrative history (problem → journey → solution)

### Template System

Templates exist for all document types:
- `DP-xxx-main-template.md` — Main debug path template
- `DP-xxx-process-template.md` — Process tracking template
- `DP-xxx-analysis-template.md` — Analysis template
- `DP-xxx-strategy-template.md` — Strategy template
- `DP-xxx-history-template.md` — History template
- `DP-xxx-tests-template.md` — Tests template

### Automation Support

The system includes automation scripts (`automation/dpf/`) for:
- Executing tests (step 1.1)
- Documenting test results (step 1.2)
- Other DRW phases (extensible)

## 🎯 Key Features & Patterns

### 1. Checklist-Driven Workflow

**Pattern:** Each round has a canonical checklist in the process file:
```markdown
## Debug Round [N] Checklist
- [ ] 1.1 Execute Tests
- [ ] 1.2 Document Test Results
- [ ] 2.1 Review Test Results
- [ ] 2.2 Analyze Root Causes
- [ ] 3.1 Update Strategy
- [ ] 3.2 Validate Strategy
- [ ] 4.1 Create Implementation Plan
- [ ] 5.1 Execute Implementation
- [ ] 5.2 Verify Implementation
- [ ] 6.1 Archive Round
- [ ] 6.2 Update Strategy
```

**Value:** Ensures no step is skipped, provides clear progress tracking, enables auditability.

---

### 2. Context Snapshot Pattern

**Pattern:** Main document maintains immutable context:
```markdown
## Context Snapshot
- **Original Problem Statement**: [NEVER CHANGES ONCE SET]
- **Current Understanding**: [MAY EVOLVE]
- **Key Findings So Far**: [CUMULATIVE]
- **Failed Approaches**: [CUMULATIVE]
```

**Value:** Prevents scope creep, maintains focus, preserves investigation history.

---

### 3. Solution Space Mapping

**Pattern:** Structured tracking of attempted and potential solutions:
```markdown
## Solution Space Mapping
### Attempted Solutions
| Approach | Round | Outcome | Why it Failed | Lessons Learned |
### Potential Solutions
| Approach | Status | Prerequisites | Expected Outcome | Risks |
```

**Value:** Prevents repeating failed approaches, documents decision rationale, supports pattern recognition.

---

### 4. Assumption Validation

**Pattern:** Explicit tracking of assumptions:
```markdown
## Assumption Validation
### Current Assumptions
| Assumption | Evidence | Validation Method | Status |
### Challenged Assumptions
| Assumption | Why We Held It | Why It Was Wrong | Round Discovered |
```

**Value:** Prevents confirmation bias, documents learning, supports objectivity.

---

### 5. Round-Based Iteration

**Pattern:** Multiple rounds with divergence checks:
```markdown
## Current Round Strategy
### Divergence Check
- Previous approaches being repeated? [Yes/No]
- If yes: What's different now? New information? Why expect different results?
```

**Value:** Prevents circular debugging, ensures each round adds value, documents strategic evolution.

---

### 6. Knowledge Extraction

**Pattern:** Systematic extraction of patterns and lessons:
```markdown
## Lessons Learned
- Patterns identified and recorded
- Anti-patterns and warning signs documented
- Lessons learned summarized for onboarding
- Central Patterns & Anti-Patterns resource updated
```

**Value:** Builds institutional memory, supports onboarding, enables pattern recognition.

## 🔄 Comparison: Debug Path vs Kanban

| Aspect | Debug Path Framework | Kanban (Epic/Story/Task) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Scope** | Test failures, regressions, bugs | All work (features, refactors, bugs) |
| **Structure** | 6-phase DRW workflow | Epic → Story → Task hierarchy |
| **Documentation** | 7 documents per DP | Epic doc, Story doc, task checklists |
| **Overhead** | Low (focused on debugging) | Medium (full project management) |
| **Traceability** | High (round-by-round audit trail) | High (version markers, changelogs) |
| **Use Case** | Reactive debugging | Proactive + reactive work |
| **Agent Support** | Checklist-driven, automatable | Agent-driven RW, automated updates |
| **Lifecycle** | Open → Rounds → Archive | Planned → In Progress → Complete |

### When to Use Each
