## DO Phase

### Changes Made

1. **Major Directory Restructuring: KB → docs/**
   - Renamed root directory from `KB/` to `docs/` (standard documentation directory)
   - All KB content moved to `docs/` level
   - Updated all path references throughout codebase (627+ files)

2. **Added knowledge/ Subdirectory**
   - Created `docs/knowledge/` as separate directory for knowledge base content
   - Moved Analysis, Reviews, Use_Cases to `docs/knowledge/`
   - Knowledge base is now separate from main documentation structure

3. **Renamed PM_and_Portfolio → Project_Management**
   - Renamed `PM_and_Portfolio/` to `Project_Management/` (single project focus, no portfolio management)
   - Updated all references throughout codebase

4. **Updated Canonical Structure Documentation**
   - Updated `ultimate-canonical-kb-structure.md` to reflect new structure
   - Clarified distinction between User_Guides and Developer_Documentation
   - Documented `knowledge/` directory purpose (articles, blog posts, analysis, reviews, use cases)
   - Proposed self-documenting names: `User_Guides/` and `Developer_Documentation/`

5. **Structure Clarification**
   - Main structure: Architecture, Changelog, Project_Management, Guides, Documentation at `docs/` level
   - Knowledge base: `docs/knowledge/` for project-specific knowledge that accumulates over time
   - Clear separation between user-facing and developer-facing documentation

## Summary

This release implements a major directory restructuring:
- **KB → docs/**: Renamed to standard documentation directory name
- **Added knowledge/**: Separate directory for project knowledge base (articles, blog posts, analysis, reviews, use cases)
- **PM_and_Portfolio → Project_Management**: Renamed for single-project focus
- **Structure clarification**: Updated canonical structure documentation with clear distinction between user-facing (Guides) and developer-facing (Documentation) content, with proposal for self-documenting names (User_Guides, Developer_Documentation)

The structure now clearly separates:
- Main documentation pillars at `docs/` level
- Knowledge base content in `docs/knowledge/` (accumulates over time)
- Clear user vs developer documentation distinction
