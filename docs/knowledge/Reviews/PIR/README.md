## PIR Workflow

### When PIR Reports Are Created

1. **Epic-Level PIR:**
   - **Trigger:** Auto-triggered when Epic is marked COMPLETE
   - **Frequency:** Always (every Epic receives a PIR)
   - **Location:** `docs/Reviews/PIR/Epic-{N}/`

2. **Story-Level PIR:**
   - **Trigger:** Auto-triggered when Story is marked COMPLETE (only for significant Stories)
   - **Frequency:** Selective (only significant Stories)
   - **Location:** `docs/Reviews/PIR/Story-{N}/`

### PIR Report Contents

Each PIR report includes:
- Executive summary
- Goals assessment
- Work items review (Stories for Epic, Tasks for Story)
- Technical assessment
- Lessons learned (what went well, what could be improved)
- Patterns and anti-patterns identified
- Follow-up actions
- Knowledge capture
- Metrics

## Using PIR Reports

### Finding PIR Reports

1. **By Epic/Story:**
   - Navigate to `Epic-{N}/` or `Story-{N}/` directory
   - Find PIR report by version number

2. **By Version:**
   - PIR reports are named with version numbers
   - Search by version in file names

3. **By Date:**
   - Check `created_at` in frontmatter
   - Sort by modification date

### Creating PIR Reports

1. **Use Templates:**
   - Epic PIR: `docs/Documentation/Templates/epic-pir-template.md`
   - Story PIR: `docs/Documentation/Templates/story-pir-template.md`

2. **Follow Workflow:**
   - See [PIR Workflow Reference](../../Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/pir-workflow-reference.md)
   - See [PIR Workflow Planning](../../Analysis/PIR-workflow-planning.md)

3. **Link to Work Items:**
   - Link PIR report to Epic/Story document (bidirectional)
   - Reference version numbers
   - Create follow-up Kanban tasks from findings
