## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Agent-Driven Execution Pattern:** The ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern proved highly effective for workflow execution, providing clear structure and intelligence.

2. **Integration Approach:** Creating separate integration guides (Kanban, versioning) for each integration point made the implementation clear and maintainable.

3. **Template-Driven Approach:** Using templates for PIR reports ensures consistency and completeness across all reviews.

4. **Incremental Development:** Completing integration tasks (T08, T09, T10) sequentially allowed for thorough testing and validation at each step.

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Test Coverage:** Automated testing for PIR workflow would improve reliability and catch issues earlier.

2. **Workflow Validation:** Additional validation steps could catch configuration errors before workflow execution.

3. **Error Recovery:** More comprehensive error recovery playbooks would improve workflow resilience.

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Integration Guide Pattern
- **Context:** When integrating workflows with other systems (Kanban, versioning, RW)
- **Value:** Provides clear documentation, examples, and implementation patterns
- **Recommendation:** Use this pattern for all future workflow integrations

### Pattern 2: Agent Execution Guide Pattern
- **Context:** When creating agent-driven workflows
- **Value:** Provides step-by-step instructions following ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED
- **Recommendation:** Follow this pattern for all agent-driven workflows

### Pattern 3: Template-Driven Documentation
- **Context:** When creating structured documentation (PIR reports, workflows)
- **Value:** Ensures consistency and completeness
- **Recommendation:** Use templates for all structured documentation

---

## Anti-Patterns Identified

### Anti-Pattern 1: Separate Versioning Systems
- **Context:** Creating separate versioning for different artifact types
- **Impact:** Breaks traceability and creates confusion
- **Recommendation:** Use project versioning schema for all artifacts

### Anti-Pattern 2: Manual Integration
- **Context:** Manually updating related documents instead of automated integration
- **Impact:** Prone to errors and inconsistencies
- **Recommendation:** Automate all integrations through workflow steps

## Knowledge Capture

### Key Insights

1. **Workflow Integration:** Successful integration requires clear documentation, bidirectional links, and automated updates.

2. Agent execution guide pattern (RW, PIR)
3. Template-driven documentation pattern (PIR reports)
