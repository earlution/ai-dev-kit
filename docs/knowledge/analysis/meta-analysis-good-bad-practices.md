## 1. Kanban Framework: Good/Bad Practices

### 1.1 Good Practices ✅

#### 1.1.1 Full-Context Task Naming (`E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`)

**Frequency:** 60% (6/10 projects)  
**Impact:** HIGH - Excellent traceability and context  
**Examples:**
- `been-there`: Uses `E1:S01:T01` format consistently
- `dev-toolkit`: Uses `E6:S06:T01` format
- `agentic-ide-rules`: Uses `E1:S01:T01` format

**Why It's Good:**
- Provides full context without needing to navigate to parent documents
- Enables easy cross-referencing and traceability
- Makes task identification unambiguous
- Supports automated tooling and validation

**Reference Implementation:** ai-dev-kit source uses full-context task naming consistently

#### 1.1.2 Proper E/S/T Hierarchy

**Frequency:** 100% (10/10 projects)  
**Impact:** HIGH - Clear organization and structure  
**Examples:**
- All projects use Epic → Story → Task hierarchy
- Consistent nesting: `epics/Epic-{N}/Story-{NNN}/Task-{YYY}.md`
- Clear parent-child relationships

**Why It's Good:**
- Provides clear organizational structure
- Enables hierarchical navigation
- Supports automated tooling
- Makes project structure intuitive

**Reference Implementation:** ai-dev-kit source demonstrates perfect E/S/T hierarchy

#### 1.1.3 Story Checklist Pattern

**Frequency:** 90% (9/10 projects)  
**Impact:** HIGH - Excellent progress tracking  
**Examples:**
- `been-there`: Story checklists in Epic documents with version markers
- `dev-toolkit`: Story checklists with status tracking
- `agentic-ide-rules`: Story checklists with completion markers

**Why It's Good:**
- Provides quick overview of story progress
- Enables version tracking (version markers)
- Supports status tracking (TODO, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETE)
- Makes epic-level progress visible

**Reference Implementation:** ai-dev-kit source uses story checklists consistently

#### 1.1.4 Comprehensive Template System

**Frequency:** 1 project (ai-dev-kit source)  
**Impact:** HIGH - Enables consistent structure  
**Example:**
- ai-dev-kit source: 21 epic templates, 62+ story templates, 193+ task templates
- Templates properly contextualized with placeholders
- Clear distinction between core (1-8) and ancillary (9-21) epics

**Why It's Good:**
- Provides standardized starting points
- Ensures consistency across projects
- Reduces setup time
- Enables best practices from the start

**Reference Implementation:** ai-dev-kit source has comprehensive template system

#### 1.1.5 Task Organization (Hybrid Approach)

**Frequency:** 67% embedded, 33% separate files  
**Impact:** MODERATE - Flexible for different task sizes  
**Examples:**

- Large tasks: Separate files in `Story-XXX/T{task}-*.md`
- Always: Task checklist in Story document

**Why It's Good:**
- Flexibility for different task sizes
- Maintains context for related tasks
- Supports granular documentation when needed
- Matches real-world usage patterns

### 1.2 Bad Practices ❌

#### 1.2.1 Epic Mashup (CRITICAL)

**Frequency:** 30% (3/10 projects: been-there, dev-toolkit, agentic-ide-rules)  
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Confusion about canonical vs project-specific epics  
**Root Cause:** Epic 9 mismatch in ai-dev-kit source (project-specific "Book Related Work" vs canonical "User Management and Authentication")

**Examples:**
- `been-there`: Has Epic 9 "Book Related Work" (inappropriate for mobile app project)
- `dev-toolkit`: Has Epic 9 "Book Related Work" (inappropriate for dev tools project)
- `agentic-ide-rules`: Has Epic 9 "Book Related Work" (inappropriate for IDE rules project)

**Why It's Bad:**
- Confuses canonical epics with project-specific epics
- Clutters Kanban boards with irrelevant epics
- Makes it unclear what actual project work is
- Undermines framework adoption quality
- **Root Cause:** ai-dev-kit source Epic 9 "Book Related Work" conflicts with canonical Epic 9

**Prevention Strategy:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Fix Epic 9 mismatch in ai-dev-kit source (rename to Epic 24+)
2. Add installer validation to prevent Epic mashup
3. Clearly distinguish canonical templates from ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban
4. Improve installation instructions

#### 1.2.2 Epic 9 Mismatch in Source (CRITICAL)

**Frequency:** 1 project (ai-dev-kit source)  
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Root cause of Epic mashup issue  
**Example:**

- Canonical template: Epic 9 "User Management and Authentication" (canonical ancillary epic)

**Why It's Bad:**
- **ROOT CAUSE** of Epic mashup issue affecting 30% of client projects
- When projects copy ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban structure, they get wrong Epic 9
- Creates internal inconsistency between ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban and canonical templates
- Propagates incorrect Epic 9 to client projects

**Required Action:**
- Rename ai-dev-kit's Epic 9 "Book Related Work" to Epic 24+ (project-specific range)
- OR: Clearly document that Epic 9 in ai-dev-kit is project-specific, not canonical
- Update all Epic 9 references in ai-dev-kit source

#### 1.2.3 Inconsistent Epic Naming

**Frequency:** 44% `Epic-{N}`, 22% `Epic {N}`, 33% `E{N}`  
**Impact:** MODERATE - Reduces consistency

- Some projects use space (`Epic 1`)
- Some projects use abbreviated (`E1`)

**Why It's Bad:**
- Reduces consistency across projects
- Makes automated tooling harder
- Creates confusion about canonical format
- Hinders cross-project collaboration

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Promote canonical `Epic-{N}` format
- Support legacy formats during migration
- Document canonical format clearly

#### 1.2.4 Inconsistent Task Padding

**Frequency:** 50% 2-digit (`T01`), 50% 3-digit (`T001`)  
**Impact:** MODERATE - Reduces consistency  
**Examples:**

- Some projects use 3-digit padding (`T001`, `T002`)

**Why It's Bad:**
- Reduces consistency across projects
- Makes automated tooling harder
- Creates confusion about canonical format

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Promote canonical 2-digit padding (`T01`)
