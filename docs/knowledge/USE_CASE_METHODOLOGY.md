# Use Case Methodology: Canonical vs Discovered Use Cases

**Purpose:** This document defines the methodology for organizing, categorizing, and managing use cases in the Knowledge Base, distinguishing between canonical (design-phase) and discovered (implementation-phase) use cases.

**Audience:** Project maintainers, designers, developers, and anyone documenting or discovering use cases

---

## Overview

Use cases in the Knowledge Base fall into two categories:

1. **Canonical Use Cases:** Planned, designed use cases identified during the design phase before implementation
2. **Discovered Use Cases:** Patterns, practices, or scenarios discovered during actual work/implementation

Both are valuable and should be documented, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics.

---

## Use Case Categories

### Canonical Use Cases

**Definition:** Use cases identified and documented during the design/planning phase, before implementation begins.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Planned and intentional
- ✅ Part of original design/architecture
- ✅ Documented before implementation
- ✅ Represent intended usage patterns
- ✅ Stable and well-defined
- ✅ Part of framework/product design

**Examples:**
- Framework adoption patterns (Template → All Packages, Existing → Some Packages)
- Workflow execution patterns (Release Workflow, Intake Workflow)
- Versioning patterns (Canonical ordering, Doc-init builds)
- Kanban organization patterns (3-tier structure, discrete task docs)

**Location:** `docs/architecture/use-cases/canonical/`

**Naming Convention:** `UC-XXX-[descriptive-title].md` (UC implies canonical)

**Metadata:**
```yaml
use_case_type: canonical
design_phase: true
discovered_during_work: false
status: active|deprecated|superseded
```

---

### Discovered Use Cases

**Definition:** Use cases, patterns, or practices discovered during actual work, implementation, or problem-solving.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Emergent from real work
- ✅ Discovered during implementation
- ✅ Represent actual patterns that emerged
- ✅ May reveal gaps in original design
- ✅ Often documented after the fact
- ✅ Can inform future canonical design

**Examples:**
- Re-opening BRs/tasks instead of creating new ones
- Bidirectional wiring between BR/FR, Tasks, and documentation
- Pattern discovery during work → documentation → wiring
- Workaround patterns that became best practices

**Location:** `docs/knowledge/use-cases/discovered/`

**Naming Convention:** `UC-D-XXX-[descriptive-title].md`

**Metadata:**
```yaml
use_case_type: discovered
design_phase: false
discovered_during_work: true
discovery_date: YYYY-MM-DD
discovered_in: [Task/BR/FR reference]
status: active|deprecated|promoted_to_canonical
```

---

## Use Case Lifecycle

### Canonical Use Cases

```
Design Phase → Document → Implement → Validate → Maintain
```

**Stages:**
1. **Design:** Identified during design/planning
2. **Documented:** Written up before implementation
3. **Implemented:** Built according to use case
4. **Validated:** Verified through usage
5. **Maintained:** Updated as needed

### Discovered Use Cases

```
Work → Pattern Recognition → Document → Wire → Validate → (Optional) Promote to Canonical
```

**Stages:**
1. **Work:** Actual work reveals pattern
2. **Recognition:** Pattern identified and recognized
3. **Documentation:** Pattern documented
4. **Wiring:** Linked to related BR/FR, Tasks, documentation
5. **Validation:** Verified through usage
6. **Promotion (Optional):** May become canonical if widely applicable

## Use Case Identification Process

### For Canonical Use Cases

1. **Design Phase:**
   - Identify use cases during design/planning
   - Document before implementation
   - Include in design documents

2. **Documentation:**
   - Create use case document
   - Link to design documents
   - Reference in Epic/Story planning

3. **Implementation:**
   - Implement according to use case
   - Validate against use case
   - Update use case with findings

### For Discovered Use Cases

1. **Recognition:**
   - Identify pattern during work
   - Recognize it's a reusable use case
   - Assess if it should be documented

2. **Documentation:**
   - Create discovered use case document
   - Document discovery context
   - Link to work that revealed it

3. **Wiring:**
   - Wire to related BR/FR
   - Wire to related Tasks
   - Wire to related documentation
   - Ensure bidirectional links

4. **Validation:**
   - Use in multiple contexts
   - Validate pattern holds
   - Document examples

5. **Promotion (Optional):**
   - Assess if should be canonical
   - Promote if widely applicable
   - Update canonical use cases

---

## Promotion Process

### When to Promote Discovered → Canonical

**Criteria:**
- ✅ Use case is widely applicable across projects
- ✅ Pattern validated through multiple uses
- ✅ Represents best practice
- ✅ Should be part of framework design
- ✅ Stable and well-understood

**Process:**
1. **Assessment:**
   - Review discovered use case
   - Evaluate against promotion criteria
   - Get consensus on promotion

2. **Promotion:**
   - Create canonical use case document
   - Reference original discovered use case
   - Update canonical index
   - Mark discovered use case as "Promoted"

3. **Integration:**
   - Include in framework design docs
   - Update templates if needed
   - Update documentation references

**Example:**
- Discovered: UC-D-002 (Bidirectional Wiring)
- Promoted to: UC-050 (Bidirectional Wiring Principle)
- Original discovered use case marked as promoted

- **Discovered:** [UC-D-XXX](../../use-cases/discovered/UC-D-XXX.md)
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Document Early:**
   - Canonical: Document during design phase
   - Discovered: Document when pattern recognized

2. **Wire Bidirectionally:**
   - Use case links to related work
   - Related work links to use case

3. **Maintain Indexes:**
   - Keep canonical index updated
   - Keep discovered index updated
   - Cross-reference between indexes

4. **Promote When Appropriate:**
   - Don't promote prematurely
   - Validate before promotion
   - Update all references

5. **Use Consistent Naming:**
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Use descriptive titles
   - Include domain in title

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Canonical Use Case

**UC-001: Framework Adoption Patterns**
- Created during design phase
- Documents intended adoption patterns
- Part of framework design
- Stable and well-defined

### Example 2: Discovered Use Case

**UC-D-001: Re-opening BRs/Tasks**
- Discovered during BR-002 reopening work
- Pattern recognized: re-open vs create new
- Documented after discovery
- Wired to BR-002, Task T06, documentation

### Example 3: Promotion

**UC-D-002: Bidirectional Wiring**
- Discovered during BR-002/T06 wiring work
- Pattern validated through usage
- Promoted to UC-050
- Now part of framework design
