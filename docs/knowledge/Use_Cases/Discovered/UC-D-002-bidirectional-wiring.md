# Use Case: Bidirectional Wiring Between BR/FR, Tasks, and Documentation

**Type:** Discovered Use Case (Promoted to Canonical)  
**ID:** UC-D-002 → UC-050  
**Discovered:** 2025-12-16  
**Promoted:** 2025-12-16  
**Status:** Active (Promoted)  
**Domain:** Knowledge Base Management

---

## Summary

Every link between work items (BR/FR, Tasks, Documentation) must be bidirectional. If BR links to Task, Task must link back to BR. This ensures traceability and discoverability across the knowledge base.

---

## Discovery Context

**How Discovered:**
- While wiring BR-002 to Task T06, recognized need for bidirectional links
- User question: "is there wiring between the BR, task, and documentation?"
- Pattern recognized: One-way links aren't sufficient for discoverability

**Discovered During:**
- **Work:** BR-002/T06 wiring work
- **Date:** 2025-12-16
- **Context:** Ensuring all related work items are discoverable

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Bidirectional links enable navigation from any starting point
- One-way links create discoverability gaps
- Pattern should be documented as principle

---

## Use Case Description

**Actor:** Project maintainers, developers, agents, knowledge base users  
**Goal:** Ensure traceability and discoverability across all work items  
**Preconditions:**
- BR/FR, Task, or Documentation exists
- Related work items exist

**Postconditions:**
- All relationships are bidirectional
- Can navigate from any work item to related items
- Links are consistent and accurate

**Main Flow:**
1. Create or update BR/FR, Task, or Documentation
2. Identify related work items
3. Add links from current item to related items
4. Add links from related items back to current item
5. Verify all links resolve correctly
6. Document wiring principle (if not already documented)

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Flow A:** New BR → Create Task → Wire both directions
- **Flow B:** Discovered pattern → Create Documentation → Wire to work that revealed it

---

## Discovery Rationale

**Why This Pattern Emerged:**
- One-way links limit discoverability
- Need to navigate from any starting point
- Consistency requires bidirectional links
- Knowledge preservation requires complete relationships

**Gap in Original Design:**
- Original design didn't explicitly require bidirectional links
- No principle documented for wiring
- Pattern wasn't part of framework design

**Lessons Learned:**
- Bidirectional links are essential for discoverability
- Pattern should be documented as principle
- Should be part of framework design
- Validation needed to ensure links exist

- ✅ Task T06 links to BR-002
- ✅ Documentation links to BR-002 and Task T06
- ✅ BR-002 and Task T06 link to documentation
- ✅ Use case links to all related work

**Implementation Status:**
- [x] Discovered
- [x] Documented
- [x] Wired to related work
- [x] Validated
- [x] Promoted to Canonical (UC-050)

## Examples

**Example 1: BR-002 ↔ Task T06 ↔ Documentation**
- **BR-002:** Links to Task T06 and Documentation
- **Task T06:** Links back to BR-002 and Documentation
- **Documentation:** Links to BR-002 and Task T06
- **Result:** Fully bidirectional, navigable from any starting point

**Example 2: Pattern Discovery → Documentation → Wiring**
- **Work:** BR-002/T06 wiring work
- **Pattern:** Bidirectional wiring principle
- **Documentation:** BIDIRECTIONAL_WIRING_PRINCIPLE.md created
- **Wiring:** All items bidirectionally linked
