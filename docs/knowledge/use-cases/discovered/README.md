# Discovered Use Cases Index

**Purpose:** Index of all discovered (implementation-phase) use cases

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-16

---

## Overview

Discovered use cases are patterns, practices, or scenarios discovered during actual work, implementation, or problem-solving. They represent emergent patterns that may reveal gaps in original design and can inform future canonical design.
