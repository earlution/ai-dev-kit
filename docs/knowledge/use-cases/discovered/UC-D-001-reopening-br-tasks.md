# Use Case: Re-opening BRs/Tasks Instead of Creating New

**Type:** Discovered Use Case  
**ID:** UC-D-001  
**Discovered:** 2025-12-16  
**Status:** Active  
**Domain:** Kanban Management

---

## Summary

When a bug persists despite a previous fix attempt, re-open the existing BR and task rather than creating new ones. This approach reduces noise, maintains continuity, and preserves context.

---

## Discovery Context

**How Discovered:**
- While re-opening BR-002 and Task E2:S01:T06, recognized this as a reusable pattern
- User feedback: "New BR adds noise. Re-open BR-02. If BR-02 had a task, re-open that too with the new context."
- Pattern recognized: Re-opening is better than creating duplicates

**Discovered During:**
- **Work:** BR-002 reopening, Task E2:S01:T06 reopening
- **Date:** 2025-12-16
- **Context:** Bug persisted despite previous fix attempt (v0.2.1.6+2)

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Re-opening maintains continuity of bug history
- Avoids duplicate BR/task proliferation
- Preserves context and lessons learned
- Reduces administrative overhead

---

## Use Case Description

**Actor:** Project maintainers, developers, agents handling bug fixes  
**Goal:** Maintain bug history continuity while addressing persistent bugs  
**Preconditions:** 
- Bug report exists
- Previous fix attempt exists
- Bug persists despite fix

**Postconditions:**
- BR re-opened with new context
- Task re-opened with new context
- History preserved
- New context documented

**Main Flow:**
1. Identify bug persists despite previous fix
2. Re-open existing BR (don't create new)
3. Add reopening context and evidence
4. Re-open related task (if exists)
5. Update task with reopening context
6. Document the pattern (if not already documented)
7. Wire everything bidirectionally

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Flow A:** No previous task exists → Create new task, link to re-opened BR
- **Flow B:** Multiple related bugs → Re-open all related BRs/tasks together

---

## Discovery Rationale

**Why This Pattern Emerged:**
- Creating new BRs for same bug creates noise
- Duplicate BRs/tasks make tracking difficult
- Re-opening preserves valuable history
- Context continuity is important

**Gap in Original Design:**
- Original design didn't explicitly address bug persistence scenarios
- No guidance on re-opening vs creating new
- Pattern wasn't documented

**Lessons Learned:**
- Re-opening is cleaner than creating duplicates
- History preservation is valuable
- Pattern should be documented for reuse
- Administrative overhead should be minimized

## Examples

**Example 1: BR-002 Re-opening**
- **BR:** BR-002 (Changelog Validator Ordering Bug)
- **Previous Fix:** E2:S01:T06 (v0.2.1.6+2) - marked complete
- **Reopening:** BR-002 and Task T06 re-opened with new context
- **Result:** Clean history, preserved context, documented pattern

**Example 2: Pattern Documentation**
- **Work:** BR-002 reopening work
- **Pattern:** Re-opening BRs/tasks
- **Documentation:** REOPENING_BR_AND_TASKS_GUIDE.md created
- **Wiring:** All items bidirectionally linked
