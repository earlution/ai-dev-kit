## Article Guidelines

### When to Create an Article

Create an article when you have:
- A comprehensive story to tell about a framework feature or decision
- Lessons learned worth sharing broadly
- Technical deep-dives that go beyond standard documentation
- Real-world case studies with valuable insights

### Article Structure

Articles should include:
- **Engaging title and introduction**
- **Problem statement** (what challenge was being solved)
- **Journey/analysis** (how the problem was approached)
- **Solution** (what was implemented)
- **Benefits and trade-offs** (what worked, what didn't)
- **Lessons learned** (key takeaways)
- **References** (links to related documentation)

### Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case: `[topic]-[descriptive-title].md`
- Be descriptive and searchable
- Examples:
  - `hybrid-task-template-system-building-better-templates.md`
  - `framework-adoption-lessons-learned.md`
  - `versioning-schema-evolution-deep-dive.md`

### Lifecycle Metadata

Articles are typically **evergreen** (permanent documentation):
- `lifecycle: evergreen`
- `ttl_days: null`
- `housekeeping_policy: keep`
