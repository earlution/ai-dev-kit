## Prioritization Score Calculation

### Base Priority Score

**Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (Severity × 0.4) + (Impact × 0.4) + (Effort × 0.2)
```

**Weighting Rationale:**
- **Severity (40%):** Criticality of the issue
- **Impact (40%):** Scope and effect of the issue
- **Effort (20%):** Inverse weight (lower effort = higher priority, adjusted in calculation)

**Effort Adjustment:**
- Effort is inverted in calculation: `(6 - Effort) × 0.2`
- Lower effort tasks get higher priority scores
- This ensures quick wins are prioritized appropriately

**Final Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (Severity × 0.4) + (Impact × 0.4) + ((6 - Effort) × 0.2)
```

### Priority Score Ranges

**Critical Priority (Score: 4.0 - 5.0):**
- Must address immediately
- Blocks development or deployment
- Critical security or functionality issues

**High Priority (Score: 3.0 - 3.9):**
- Should address within 1-2 development cycles
- Significant impact on functionality or quality
- Important for codebase health

**Medium Priority (Score: 2.0 - 2.9):**
- Should address within 2-4 development cycles
- Moderate impact on functionality or quality
- Contributes to codebase health

**Low Priority (Score: 1.0 - 1.9):**
- Address as time permits
- Minor impact on functionality or quality
- Nice-to-have improvements

**Minimal Priority (Score: 0.0 - 0.9):**
- Optional, address when convenient
- Negligible impact
- Purely cosmetic or theoretical

---

## Contextual Adjustments

### Strategic Importance

**Adjustment Factor:** ±0.5 to Priority Score

**High Strategic Importance (+0.5):**
- Aligns with project goals or roadmap
- Enables future work or features
- Addresses technical debt that blocks progress
- Improves developer experience significantly

**Low Strategic Importance (-0.5):**
- Not aligned with current priorities
- Deferred or low-value work
- Cosmetic improvements only
- Theoretical benefits only

### Dependency Considerations

**Adjustment Factor:** ±0.3 to Priority Score

**Blocks Other Work (+0.3):**
- Prevents other tasks from proceeding
- Required for dependent features
- Blocks critical workflows

**Depends on Other Work (-0.3):**
- Cannot proceed until other work is complete
- Lower urgency until dependencies resolved

### Risk Factors

**Adjustment Factor:** ±0.2 to Priority Score

**High Risk (+0.2):**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity risks
- System stability concerns
- Compliance issues

**Low Risk (-0.2):**
- Low-risk changes
- Well-tested code paths
- Isolated changes

**Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 5 (Critical - prevents execution)
- **Impact:** 5 (Critical - blocks framework health monitoring)
- **Effort:** 1 (Minimal - simple syntax fix)

**Calculation:**
```
Priority Score = (5 × 0.4) + (5 × 0.4) + ((6 - 1) × 0.2)
               = 2.0 + 2.0 + 1.0
               = 5.0
```

**Result:** Critical Priority (5.0) - Must Have (M)

**Action:** Address immediately

### Example 2: Code Quality Warning

**Task:** Reduce cyclomatic complexity in `validate_version_bump.py` (currently 15, target: 10)

**Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 2 (Low - warning, doesn't prevent execution)
- **Impact:** 3 (Medium - affects code maintainability)
- **Effort:** 3 (Medium - requires refactoring)

**Calculation:**
```
Priority Score = (2 × 0.4) + (3 × 0.4) + ((6 - 3) × 0.2)
               = 0.8 + 1.2 + 0.6
               = 2.6
```

**Result:** Medium Priority (2.6) - Could Have (C)

**Action:** Address within 2-4 development cycles

### Example 3: Security Vulnerability

**Task:** Update dependency with known security vulnerability (CVE-2024-XXXX)

**Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 5 (Critical - security vulnerability)
- **Impact:** 4 (High - affects security posture)
- **Effort:** 2 (Low - dependency update)

**Contextual Adjustments:**
- **Risk Factor:** +0.2 (High risk - security issue)

**Calculation:**
```
Base Score = (5 × 0.4) + (4 × 0.4) + ((6 - 2) × 0.2)
           = 2.0 + 1.6 + 0.8
           = 4.4
Adjusted Score = 4.4 + 0.2 = 4.6
```

**Result:** Critical Priority (4.6) - Must Have (M)

**Action:** Address urgently (within 1 development cycle)

### Example 4: Documentation Update

**Task:** Update outdated documentation in `framework-health-metrics.md`

**Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 1 (Informational - documentation issue)
- **Impact:** 2 (Low - affects documentation quality)
- **Effort:** 1 (Minimal - documentation update)

**Calculation:**
```
Priority Score = (1 × 0.4) + (2 × 0.4) + ((6 - 1) × 0.2)
               = 0.4 + 0.8 + 1.0
               = 2.2
```

**Result:** Medium Priority (2.2) - Could Have (C)

**Action:** Address as time permits

## Decision Record

**Decision:** Implement multi-dimensional prioritization framework with severity, impact, and effort dimensions, weighted scoring, and Kanban integration.

**Rationale:**
- Provides systematic, objective prioritization
- Considers multiple factors for balanced decisions
- Integrates seamlessly with Kanban framework
- Supports continuous improvement

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single-dimension prioritization (too simplistic)
- Unweighted dimensions (doesn't reflect importance)
- Manual-only prioritization (inconsistent)
- Tool-based prioritization (adds dependencies)

**Consequences:**
- Requires initial assessment effort
- Framework may need refinement based on experience
- Provides foundation for systematic maintenance
- Enables data-driven prioritization decisions
