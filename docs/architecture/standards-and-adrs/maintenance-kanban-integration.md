## Task Creation and Assignment

### Maintenance Task Creation Process

**Step 1: Identify Maintenance Need**

Sources of maintenance tasks:
- IDE-flagged issues (errors, warnings, info)
- Code quality analysis
- Technical debt tracking
- Framework health monitoring
- User feedback (Bug Reports)
- Code reviews
- Scheduled maintenance reviews

**Step 2: Assess and Prioritize**

Apply Maintenance Task Prioritization Framework:
1. Assess severity (1-5)
2. Assess impact (1-5)
3. Estimate effort (1-5)
4. Calculate priority score
5. Apply contextual adjustments
6. Determine MoSCOW classification

**Step 3: Create Kanban Task**

Task Creation:
- **Epic Assignment:** Epic 7 (Codebase Maintenance and Review)
- **Story Assignment:** Assign to appropriate Story
  - E7:S01 for general maintenance tasks
  - E7:S02 for code review tasks
  - E7:S03 for quality monitoring tasks
  - E7:S04 for automation tasks
- **Task Document:** Create task document following Epic 4 templates
- **Task Metadata:** Include priority score, severity, impact, effort, MoSCOW

**Step 4: Update Kanban Board**

Board Updates:
- Add task to Kanban board
- Assign to appropriate MoSCOW section
- Update Story task checklist
- Update Epic story checklist
- Set task status (TODO, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETE)

---

## Prioritization and MoSCOW Mapping

### Priority Score to MoSCOW Classification

**Mapping:**
- **Critical Priority (4.0-5.0):** **Must Have (M)**
  - Blocks development or deployment
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Critical errors
  - System failures
- **High Priority (3.0-3.9):** **Should Have (S)**
  - Significant functional issues
  - Major performance problems
  - High-risk security warnings
  - Important quality issues
- **Medium Priority (2.0-2.9):** **Could Have (C)**
  - Minor functional issues
  - Noticeable performance degradation
  - Code quality improvements
  - Moderate technical debt
- **Low Priority (1.0-1.9):** **Could Have (C)**
  - Cosmetic issues
  - Minor inefficiencies
  - Informational IDE warnings
  - Low-priority improvements
- **Minimal Priority (<1.0):** **Won't Have (W)**
  - Best practice suggestions
  - Minor refactoring opportunities
  - Optional improvements
  - Deferred work

### Kanban Board Organization

**MoSCOW Sections:**
- **Must Have (M):** Critical maintenance tasks requiring immediate attention
- **Should Have (S):** Important maintenance tasks to address soon
- **Could Have (C):** Nice-to-have maintenance tasks for when time permits
- **Ongoing (O):** Perpetual maintenance tasks that never complete (tracked but don't block other work)
- **Won't Have (W):** Deferred maintenance tasks

**Task Ordering:**
- Within each MoSCOW section, tasks ordered by:
  1. Priority score (highest first)
  2. Severity (highest first)
  3. Impact (highest first)
  4. Last updated (most recent first)

## Decision Record

**Decision:** Integrate maintenance tasks comprehensively with Kanban framework, using Epic 7 as organizational structure and Epic 4's Kanban framework for task management.

**Rationale:**
- Provides systematic approach to maintenance task tracking
- Ensures visibility of maintenance work alongside feature development
- Enables prioritization-driven maintenance management
- Integrates with existing Kanban framework and workflows
- Supports metrics and reporting for maintenance effectiveness

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Separate maintenance tracking system (fragmentation, reduced visibility)
- Ad-hoc maintenance without tracking (inconsistent, no visibility)
- Manual tracking only (not scalable, error-prone)
- Tool-only tracking (lacks process integration)

**Consequences:**
- Requires initial setup and documentation
- Maintenance tasks visible in Kanban board
- Enables systematic maintenance management
- Supports data-driven maintenance decisions
- Integrates with existing workflows
