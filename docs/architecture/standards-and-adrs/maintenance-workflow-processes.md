### Trigger

- **Continuous:** IDE flags issues during development
- **RW Step 9:** Check for and address IDE-flagged problems
- **Scheduled:** Weekly/bi-weekly maintenance reviews
- **Manual:** Developer identifies issues during work

### Workflow Steps

#### Step 1: Issue Detection

**Sources:**
- IDE/editor error/warning/info messages
- Linter output
- Static analysis tools
- Code review findings

**Detection Methods:**
- **Automated:** IDE flags issues in real-time

- **Manual Review:** Developer reviews codebase
- **Tool-Based:** Run linting/analysis tools

**Documentation:**
- Capture issue details (file, line, message, severity)
- Note context and potential impact
- Document any related issues

#### Step 2: Issue Categorization

**Categorize by Type:**
- **Errors:** Critical issues preventing execution/compilation
- **Warnings:** Issues that may cause problems
- **Info:** Suggestions and best practices

**Categorize by Source:**

- **Could Have (C):** Medium-priority warnings, improvements
- **Won't Have (W):** Low-priority info, cosmetic issues

**Documentation:**
- Record priority score and classification
- Document reasoning for prioritization
- Create Kanban task if needed

#### Step 4: Batch Processing

**Group Similar Issues:**

#### Step 5: Resolution

**Fix Process:**
1. Understand issue root cause
2. Implement fix
3. Test fix (unit tests, manual testing)
4. Verify no regressions
5. Document fix approach

**Quality Checks:**
- Fix addresses root cause
- No new issues introduced
- Code quality maintained or improved
- Tests pass (if applicable)

**Documentation:**

## Decision Record

**Decision:** Implement comprehensive maintenance workflow processes with four workflow types, Kanban integration, and tool integration.

**Rationale:**
- Provides systematic approach to maintenance
- Integrates with existing tools and workflows
- Supports different maintenance scenarios
- Enables continuous codebase health management

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single workflow for all maintenance (too rigid)
- Ad-hoc maintenance (inconsistent)
- Tool-only workflows (lacks process guidance)
- Manual-only workflows (not scalable)

**Consequences:**
- Requires initial setup and documentation
- Workflows may need refinement based on experience
- Provides foundation for systematic maintenance
- Enables efficient maintenance work
