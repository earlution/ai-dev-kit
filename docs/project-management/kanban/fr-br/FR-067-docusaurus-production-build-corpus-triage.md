# Feature Request: Docusaurus Production Build — Corpus Triage

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**ID:** FR-067  
**Submitted:** 2026-03-30  
**Submitted By:** User (via agent)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Assigned Task:** E5:S09:T03 — [`T03-docusaurus-build-triage-fr-067.md`](../epics/Epic-5/Story-009-docusaurus-documentation-portal/T03-docusaurus-build-triage-fr-067.md)

---

## Summary

After **FR-066** points the site at repo `docs/`, make **`npm run build`** succeed for the **agreed publish scope**, by triaging **MDX compilation errors**, **broken links** (per `onBrokenLinks` policy), and any **asset path** issues—with minimal content churn outside fixes required for the build.

---

## Problem Statement

Repo `docs/` has hundreds of markdown files, mixed frontmatter, and links that assume GitHub or editor contexts. A strict `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` gate blocks the first green build until link hygiene catches up; triage may use `warn` with an explicit policy (see portal README) while remediating.

---

## Scope (Atomic)

**In scope**

- Iterative fixes or **narrowing FR-066 exclude list** (with scope doc updated) until `npm run build` exits **0**.
- Document **temporary** relaxations (e.g. `onBrokenLinks: 'warn'` during migration) **only** if justified with a time-boxed follow-up; prefer fixing links or excluding problematic subtrees per publish policy.
- Coordinate with **FR-058** / MMW where fixes are systemic markdown hygiene.

**Out of scope**

- Perfect editorial quality of all docs.
- Sidebar UX (FR-068).
- CI automation (FR-069).

---

## Functional Requirements

- [x] **FR-067:R01** – `npm run build` in `portal/` passes on CI-representative Node version (≥20 per `package.json` engines).
- [x] **FR-067:R02** – Broken link policy is **explicit** in config and portal README (`warn` + target `throw`; see triage note).
- [x] **FR-067:R03** – Excludes unchanged from FR-066; documented in README (no additional subtrees excluded for links).
- [x] **FR-067:R04** – Triage note: [`docs/maintenance/docusaurus-corpus-triage-fr-067.md`](../../../../maintenance/docusaurus-corpus-triage-fr-067.md); tests: `tests/test_portal_fr067_build_triage.py`.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] **FR-067:NF01** – Prefer **surgical** edits (escape MDX, fix links, frontmatter) over bulk rewrites. *(Applied: targeted MDX escapes, placeholder script, limited prose edits.)*
- [x] **FR-067:NF02** – No false “Fixed” claims in changelogs; use project release language rules.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Clean production build for the defined publish scope (`npm run build` exit 0).
- [x] AC2: Publish scope doc matches actual includes/excludes (FR-066 globs + README).
- [x] AC3: Triage summary exists for future maintenance.

---

## Dependencies / Ordering

- **FR-066** must be complete (docs path + scope defined).

## Related FRs

- **FR-058** – Markdown Maintenance Workflow.
- **FR-068** – Sidebar / landing (may start after AC1).

---

## Follow-up work (explicit tracking — do not rely on memory)

Anything “to be done later” from FR-067 must have an **FR and/or Kanban task** below so maintainers are not expected to recall chat context.

| ID | Outcome | Purpose | Tracked as |
|----|---------|---------|------------|
| **FU-1** | Restore **strict** broken-link checking (`onBrokenLinks` / `onBrokenMarkdownLinks` → **`throw`**) | Interim **`warn`** was intentional (FR-067 Problem Statement + portal README); strict mode enforces zero broken links in build/CI once corpus is repaired. | **Task:** [E5:S09:T08](../epics/Epic-5/Story-009-docusaurus-documentation-portal/T08-docusaurus-strict-broken-links-post-fr067.md). **Coordinate:** [FR-058](./FR-058-markdown-maintenance-workflow.md) for systemic link/path hygiene. |
| **FU-2** | **GitHub Release** page for published **SemVer** tags (optional ops) | Tags exist on `git push`; Releases UI is populated only if RW Step 12.5 runs with token. | **Process:** [Release Workflow Step 12.5](../../../../.cursorrules) in project `.cursorrules` — [`create_github_release.py`](../../../../packages/frameworks/workflow%20mgt/scripts/create_github_release.py). Not a portal FR; no separate Kanban task unless RW adoption gaps are filed elsewhere. |

**Docs that echo this table:** [docusaurus corpus triage note](../../../maintenance/docusaurus-corpus-triage-fr-067.md) (Deferred outcomes), [portal README](../../../../portal/README.md) (Broken links section).
