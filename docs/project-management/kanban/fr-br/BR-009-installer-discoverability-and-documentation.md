# Bug Report: Kanban Framework Installation Copies ai-dev-kit's Actual Kanban Instead of Canonical Template

**Type:** Bug Report (BR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-11  
**Submitted By:** earlution (agentic-ide-rules project)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** RESOLVED ✅ (v0.4.6.9+2 via E4:S06:T09)  
**GitHub Issue:** #14

---

## Summary

When installing the Kanban framework from ai-dev-kit, the installation process copied ai-dev-kit's **actual Kanban board** (with their project-specific epics like "AI Dev Kit Core", "Workflow Management Framework", etc.) instead of installing the **canonical Kanban template** that should be customized for the consuming project.

---

## Description

### What is the Bug?

The interactive installation process (`install_kanban_framework.py`) exists but is not discoverable or documented as the primary installation method. Users manually copy files and receive ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban structure instead of canonical templates.

**Root Issues:**
1. **Installer Not Discoverable:** The interactive installer exists but isn't prominently featured in installation instructions
2. **Documentation Gap:** README doesn't clearly distinguish between:
   - Canonical epic templates (for reference)
   - ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban (example only, not for copying)
3. **Manual Copying Problem:** Users manually copy `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/*` and get ai-dev-kit's project-specific content
4. **No Warning:** No warning when users manually copy instead of using installer

### What Should Happen vs. What Actually Happens?

**Expected Behavior:**
- Interactive installer (`install_kanban_framework.py`) is the **primary/only** installation method
- README clearly emphasizes using the installer
- Installer:
  1. Detects existing Kanban structures
  2. Analyzes and generates migration plan
  3. Prompts for installation mode selection (Fresh, Migration, Update, Hybrid)
  4. **Installs canonical core epics** (templates, not ai-dev-kit's actual epics)
  5. Customizes the Kanban structure for the consuming project's needs
- Installation results in:
  - Canonical epic templates (Epic-1-Project-Core.md, etc.) available for reference
  - **Empty epic directories** ready for the project to create their own epics
  - Project-specific customization based on interactive prompts

**Actual Behavior:**
- Users manually copy files: `cp -r packages/frameworks/ai-dev-kit/docs/project-management/kanban/epics/* docs/project-management/kanban/epics/`
- Receive direct copy of ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban board
- Get ai-dev-kit's project-specific epics (Epic-1: AI Dev Kit Core, Epic-2: Workflow Management Framework, etc.)
- Get ai-dev-kit's actual stories and tasks with their specific content
- No interactive installation process executed
- No customization for consuming project

### When Does It Occur?

- When installing Kanban framework via Git submodule
- When manually copying Kanban structure files
- When installer is not discovered or used
- During initial project setup from ai-dev-kit template

### Who is Affected?

**Primary Affected:**
- Projects installing Kanban framework (e.g., agentic-ide-rules)
- Users expecting canonical templates, not ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban
- Framework adopters who don't discover the installer

**Secondary Affected:**
- Framework maintainers (support burden)
- Documentation consumers (confusion about installation method)

---

## Installation Method Used

**Method:** Git submodule + manual file copy
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/earlution/ai-dev-kit.git packages/frameworks/ai-dev-kit
cp -r packages/frameworks/ai-dev-kit/docs/project-management/kanban/epics/* docs/project-management/kanban/epics/
```

**Discovery Process Issues:**
- Installation documentation wasn't clear that:
  1. There's an interactive installer that should be used
  2. The canonical templates are different from ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban
  3. The installer should customize epics for the consuming project
- **Multiple attempts** needed to understand:
  - First attempt: Only copied templates, not understanding canonical epics should be installed
  - Second attempt: Copied ai-dev-kit's actual epics, not realizing these were project-specific
  - Only after explicit clarification understood the distinction
- Even then ended up with ai-dev-kit's actual epics rather than properly customized installation

---

## Affected Component

**Primary Component:** Kanban Framework - Installation Process & Documentation  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Installation Process
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Backend/API
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [ ] Integration/External Service

**Root Cause:**
- Installer exists but isn't discoverable
- Documentation doesn't emphasize installer as primary method
- No clear distinction between canonical templates and ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban
- No warning when users manually copy files

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install ai-dev-kit as Git submodule
2. Look for installation instructions in README
3. Find instructions mention installer but don't emphasize it
4. Manually copy Kanban structure: `cp -r packages/frameworks/ai-dev-kit/docs/project-management/kanban/epics/* docs/project-management/kanban/epics/`
5. **Result:** Receive ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban with project-specific epics
6. **Expected:** Should have been directed to use installer, which would provide canonical templates

---

## Environment

**Environment:** Development  
**Version:** Kanban Framework v2.1.0 (latest as of 2025-12-11)  
**Project:** agentic-ide-rules  
**Installation method:** Git submodule  
**Python version:** 3.x

---

## Impact

**User Impact:**
- **High:** Projects get ai-dev-kit's project-specific content instead of clean, customizable template
- **High:** Multiple back-and-forth interactions needed to understand what should be installed
- **Medium:** Projects must manually clean up ai-dev-kit-specific content
- **Medium:** Confusion about what "canonical" means vs. "ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban"

**Business Impact:**
- Framework adoption friction
- Support burden from confused users
- Framework credibility affected by unclear installation process

**Workaround:**
- Manually clean up ai-dev-kit-specific content
- Use installer after manual copy (defeats purpose)
- Understand distinction through trial and error

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Fix Requirements)

- [ ] **Criterion 1:** README clearly emphasizes `install_kanban_framework.py` as the **primary/only** installation method
- [ ] **Criterion 2:** README clearly distinguishes between:
  - Canonical epic templates (for reference)
  - ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban (example only, not for copying)
- [ ] **Criterion 3:** Installer is prominently featured in installation instructions (not buried)
- [ ] **Criterion 4:** Installer defaults to installing canonical templates, not copying ai-dev-kit's actual board
- [ ] **Criterion 5:** Warning added if someone tries to manually copy epics (direct them to installer)
- [ ] **Criterion 6:** Installation documentation includes clear examples of what users should expect

**Verification Method:**
- Manual testing (new user installation scenario)
- Documentation review
- User feedback

---

## Suggested Fix

1. **Make installer primary/only method** - Update documentation to make `install_kanban_framework.py` the recommended installation path
2. **Clarify in README** - Distinguish between:
   - Canonical epic templates (for reference)
   - ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban (example only, not for copying)
3. **Improve discoverability** - Installer script should be prominently featured in installation instructions
4. **Default behavior** - Installer should default to installing canonical templates, not copying ai-dev-kit's actual board
5. **Add warning** - If someone tries to manually copy epics, add a warning that they should use the installer instead

## Notes

**Resolution:** Fixed in `v0.4.6.10+2` by making the installer the primary/only installation method, clearly distinguishing canonical templates vs. ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban, adding warnings against manual copying, providing expected installation outputs, and adding troubleshooting steps. Implemented in E4:S06:T09 with README and post-template setup guide updates.

This bug report documents installation discoverability and documentation issues. The interactive installer exists (E4:S07) but isn't being used because it's not discoverable. This is related to BR-004 but focuses on installer discoverability rather than epic contamination per se.

**User Experience:**
- Real-world installation scenario
- Multiple attempts to understand what should be installed
- Confusion about canonical vs. project-specific content
