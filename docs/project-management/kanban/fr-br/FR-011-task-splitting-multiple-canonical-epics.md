# Feature Request: Task Splitting Across Multiple Canonical Epics

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-10  
**Submitted By:** AI Agent (Cursor) acting as user/client for dev-toolkit  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** PENDING  
**GitHub Issue:** [#7](https://github.com/earlution/ai-dev-kit/issues/7) (Additional Context Comment)

## Summary

Enhance intelligent task mapping to support splitting user tasks across multiple canonical epics when a user epic partially matches multiple canonical epics, enabling optimal organization.

---

## Description

### What functionality is desired?

**Task Splitting Capability:**

When a user epic partially matches multiple canonical epics, intelligently split user tasks across the matching canonical epics based on task content analysis.

**Example Scenario:**
- User Epic 3: "Versioning & Release Workflow"
- Partial matches:
  - Canonical Epic 3: "Versioning Framework" (65% similarity)
  - Canonical Epic 2: "Workflow Management Framework" (55% similarity)

- **Solution:** Split tasks intelligently
  - Versioning tasks → Canonical Epic 3
  - Workflow tasks → Canonical Epic 2


### What problem does this solve?

**Current Problem:**
- Migration only maps to "best" match (single canonical epic)
- User epic with multiple partial matches gets mapped to only one canonical epic
- Tasks may end up in sub-optimal location if epic has mixed responsibilities
- No support for splitting tasks across multiple canonical epics

**This Feature Solves:**
- **Optimal Organization:** Tasks placed in correct canonical epics based on content
- **Intelligent Splitting:** AI analyzes task content to determine best canonical epic
- **Better Structure:** Leverages canonical structure fully even for mixed-responsibility epics

### What is the use case?

**Primary Use Case:** Bob has Epic 3: "Versioning & Release Workflow" with tasks:
- T01: "Implement versioning schema" → Maps to Canonical Epic 3 (Versioning)
- T02: "Create release workflow" → Maps to Canonical Epic 2 (Workflow)
- T03: "Version bump automation" → Maps to Canonical Epic 3 (Versioning)

**Result:** Tasks intelligently split across appropriate canonical epics for optimal organization.

### Who would benefit from this feature?

- **Users with mixed-responsibility epics** - Get optimal task placement
- **Projects adopting canonical structure** - Better organization through intelligent splitting
- **AI agents** - Can automate task splitting based on content analysis

## Notes

This feature request was identified from additional context provided in GitHub Issue #7 comments (Scenario 2: Partial Match).

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Basic semantic matching implemented
- ✅ Single best match mapping implemented
- ⚠️ Task splitting across multiple canonical epics - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Enhancement Needed:**
- Analyze task content (not just epic content) for canonical epic matching
- Support multiple canonical epic matches per user epic
- Split tasks intelligently based on task-level content analysis
