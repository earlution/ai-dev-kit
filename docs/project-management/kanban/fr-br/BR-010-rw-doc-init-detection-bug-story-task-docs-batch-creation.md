# Bug Report: RW Doc-Init Detection Bug (Story + Task Docs Batch Creation)

**Type:** Bug Report (BR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-18  
**Submitted By:** User (discovered during E4:S13:T04)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** FIXED

---

## Summary

Release Workflow (RW) doc-init detection logic incorrectly sets BUILD=0 instead of BUILD=1 when Story + all Task docs are created together in story's abstract space (v0.E.S.0+0), then first implementation work begins on a task. The bug occurs because the detection function doesn't check if the task document already exists (even if not created in the current commit).

---

## Description

**What is the bug?**
The `detect_first_time_est_doc` function in `validate_version_bump.py` incorrectly identifies first implementation work as doc-init (BUILD=0) when:
1. Story + all Task docs created together in story's abstract space (v0.E.S.0+0)
2. Task document already exists (from previous commit)
3. No task-level version exists yet (no S.T+* version in history)
4. First implementation work begins (code changes, not docs-only)

**What should happen vs. what actually happens?**
- **Expected:** RW should detect that Task document already exists → NOT doc-init → BUILD=1 (first functional build)
- **Actual:** RW incorrectly detects this as doc-init → BUILD=0 (incorrect version)

**When does it occur?**
- When Story + all Task docs are created together in a single commit (story's abstract space)
- When first implementation work begins on any task (code changes present)
- During Release Workflow Step 2 (Bump Version)
- When no task-level version exists yet (no prior S.T+* version in history)

**Who is affected?**
- Developers using batch creation workflow (Story + Task docs together)
- Release Workflow execution (incorrect versioning)
- Version tracking accuracy (BUILD=0 instead of BUILD=1)

**Valid Use Case:**
This bug was exposed by a **valid use case**: Story + Task docs batch creation. The workflow is legitimate and efficient, but exposed a design flaw in state detection logic.

---

## Affected Component

**Primary Component:** Release Workflow Validation Scripts  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Backend/API
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [ ] Integration/External Service
- [ ] Documentation
- [x] Other: Validation Scripts, Version Bump Logic

**Root Cause:**
The `detect_first_time_est_doc` function in `validate_version_bump.py` has flawed logic:
- Function checks if task doc was created in THIS commit
- Function checks if prior version exists
- **Missing Check:** Function doesn't verify if task doc already exists (even if not created in this commit)
- **Flawed Assumption:** "No prior version = doc-init"

**Design Flaw Pattern:**
This represents an **abstract anti-pattern**: **Use Case Exposed Design Flaw**
- Valid use case (Story + Task docs batch creation) exists
- Use case exposes design flaw (state detection logic)
- Flaw is fixed, but use case remains relevant as knowledge

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create Story document (e.g., `Story-013-kanban-board-moscow-prioritized-task-view.md`)
2. Create all Task documents for that Story in the same commit
3. Commit all documents together in story's abstract space (v0.E.S.0+0)
4. Begin implementation work on Task 1 (make code changes, not just docs)
5. Run Release Workflow (RW) to version the work
6. **Expected result:** RW detects task doc exists → BUILD=1 (first functional build)
7. **Actual result (before fix):** RW incorrectly detects doc-init → BUILD=0 (incorrect)

**Example Scenario:**
```
Commit 1: Story + Task docs created together
- Story-013-kanban-board-moscow-prioritized-task-view.md
- T01-kanban-board-moscow-prioritized-task-view.md
- T02-update-kanban-governance-policy.md
- T03-update-kanban-board-template.md
- T04-assess-system-impacts.md
- T05-update-kanban-package.md
- T06-update-other-affected-packages.md
Version: v0.4.13.0+0 (story creation, doc-init)

Commit 2: First implementation work on T01
- Code changes in kanban-board.md
- Run RW
- Expected: v0.4.13.1+1 (first functional build)
- Actual (before fix): v0.4.13.1+0 (incorrect doc-init)
```

---

## Environment

**Environment:** Development  
**Version:** v0.4.13.4+1 (bug fixed)  
**Browser/Platform:** N/A  
**OS:** macOS (darwin 24.6.0)

**Affected Systems:**
- Release Workflow (RW) Step 2 (Bump Version)
- Version validation scripts
- Any project using batch creation workflow

---

## Impact

**User Impact:**
- [ ] Critical - System unusable
- [x] High - Major functionality broken (incorrect versioning)
- [ ] Medium - Some functionality affected
- [ ] Low - Minor issue, workaround available

**Business Impact:**
- Incorrect version numbers (BUILD=0 instead of BUILD=1)
- Version tracking accuracy compromised
- Changelog entries show incorrect build numbers
- Forensic traceability affected

**Workaround:**
- Create Task documents separately (not in batch with Story)
- Manually correct version after RW runs
- Avoid batch creation workflow (not recommended - workflow is valid)

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Fix Requirements)

- [x] Function checks if task document already exists (even if not created in this commit)
- [x] Function correctly identifies when task doc exists from previous commit
- [x] Function sets BUILD=1 (not BUILD=0) when task doc exists and code changes present
- [x] Function only returns `is_first_time = True` if task doc is created in THIS commit AND docs-only AND no prior version
- [x] Documentation updated with new use case scenario and fix explanation

**Verification Method:**
- [x] Test suite execution
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Both

**Fix Verification Status:**
- [x] Verified (test suite passed / manual test passed)
- [ ] Attempted Fix (pending verification)
- [ ] Fix Failed (bug still present)

## Fix Attempt History

**Purpose:** This section documents all fix attempts for this bug, ensuring that if a bug isn't squashed, the next build can be informed by previous attempts.

**How to Use:**
- Each release that attempts to fix this bug should add a new entry to this section
- Document what was attempted, what worked, what didn't, and verification status
- This creates a knowledge base for future fix attempts

### Fix Attempts

#### Attempt 1: v0.4.13.4+1 - 2025-12-18

**Fix Description:**
Updated `detect_first_time_est_doc` function in `validate_version_bump.py` to check if task document already exists before determining doc-init state. Added task document existence check using `locate_task_doc` function.

**Changes Made:**
- Added check: If task document already exists (using `locate_task_doc` function) → NOT doc-init
- If task doc exists but wasn't created in this commit → `is_first_time = False` → BUILD=1
- Only returns `is_first_time = True` if task doc is created in THIS commit AND docs-only AND no prior version
- Updated RW execution guide documentation with new use case scenario (Example 4)
- Updated T04 task document with bug analysis and fix

**Files Updated:**
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_version_bump.py` (bug fix)
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` (documentation)
- `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-4/Story-013-kanban-board-moscow-prioritized-task-view/T04-assess-system-impacts.md` (task doc)

**Verification Status:**
- [x] Verified (test suite passed / manual test passed)
- [ ] Attempted Fix (pending verification)
- [ ] Fix Failed (bug still present)

**Verification Method:**
- [x] Test suite execution
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Both

**Verification Evidence:**
- Manual test: Story + Task docs created together → First implementation work → BUILD=1 ✅ (correct)
- Function correctly identifies when task doc exists from previous commit
- Function sets BUILD=1 when task doc exists and code changes present
- Function only returns `is_first_time = True` for actual doc-init scenarios

**Result:**
- [x] Bug Fixed
- [ ] Bug Partially Fixed (describe partial fix)
- [ ] Bug Not Fixed (describe why fix didn't work)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always check for object existence, not just creation events
- Verify state independently of operation context
- Don't assume "no prior version = first time"
- Consider batch operations and parent-child relationships when designing state detection
- Valid use cases can expose design flaws (abstract anti-pattern)

**Next Steps:**
- None - bug is fixed
- Use case remains relevant as knowledge (abstract anti-pattern)
