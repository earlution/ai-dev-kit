# Bug Report BR-063 — RW `-k` task attribution drift (requested task vs version anchor)

**Status:** OPEN  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Severity:** CRITICAL — **forensic integrity blocker:** release records can claim one task while version/tag lineage anchors a different task.  
**Created:** 2026-04-07  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-07 — `E2:S01:T13` completed forensic cleanup of `v0.2.1.10+6` attribution records; validator/runtime hardening remains OPEN.  
**Version:** v0.2.1.13+1  
**Code:** BR-063  
**Implementing Task:** [E2:S01:T13](../epics/Epic-2/Story-001-rw-agent-execution-and-docs/T13-rw-k-forensic-task-attribution-alignment-br063.md)

---

## Problem Statement

`RW -k` accepts an explicit requested task id for intent context, but release attribution can still follow the existing `version.py` task lineage. This can produce split accountability:

- commit/changelog narrative references requested task (example: `T12`)
- internal version/tag lineage remains a different task (example: `T10+6`)

This breaks forensic traceability and creates ambiguous responsibility for what was actually released.

---

## Expected Behavior

For a single release, task attribution must be single-source and consistent across:

1. `version.py` (`RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`)
2. commit footer (`Epic | Story | Task`)
3. internal/semver release tags
4. main and detailed changelog entries
5. BR implementing-task linkage where applicable

If requested task and computed version task differ, RW must hard-fail unless an explicit reconciliation mode is chosen.

---

## Reproduction

1. Run `RW -k E2:S01:T12`.
2. Observe version lineage increments on `T10` (`0.2.1.10+6`).
3. Observe release/changelog text attributed to `T12`.
4. Result: release artifacts disagree on accountable task.

---

## Proposed Resolution

- Add explicit `RW -k` attribution guard that compares requested task id with computed version task anchor.
- If mismatch, abort by default and require an explicit operator choice:
  - adopt requested task as canonical release anchor, or
  - keep computed anchor and rewrite all release metadata accordingly.
- Add regression coverage for mismatch scenario.
