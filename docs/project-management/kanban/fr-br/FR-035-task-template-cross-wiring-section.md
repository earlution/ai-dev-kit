# Feature Request: Task Template Cross-Wiring Section

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2026-01-16  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**GitHub Issue:** [TBD]  
**Version:** v0.5.1.35+0 (migrated from v0.5.0.35+0)

---

## Summary

Enhance the Task Template (`TASK_TEMPLATE.md`) to include an explicit "Cross-Wiring" or "Interconnected Tasks" section that provides clear guidance on linking related tasks, emphasizes bidirectional wiring, and contextualizes relationships between interconnected tasks.

**Related SoP:** A Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) has been created to define cross-wiring procedures: [`task-template-cross-wiring-sop.md`](../../../architecture/standards-and-adrs/task-template-cross-wiring-sop.md)

---

## Description

### What is the Feature?

A dedicated section in the Task Template that explicitly addresses cross-wiring and interconnected tasks, providing:

1. **Explicit "Cross-Wiring" Section:**
   - Clear guidance on linking related tasks
   - Emphasis on bidirectional wiring (links go both ways)
   - Relationship types (complements, coordinates with, informs, etc.)
   - Context for why tasks are related

2. **Enhanced "Related Work" Section:**
   - Better guidance on bidirectional wiring
   - Reference to bidirectional wiring principle
   - Examples of proper cross-wiring patterns

3. **Integration with Existing Sections:**
   - Clear distinction between "Dependencies" (blocking/depends-on) and "Cross-Wiring" (related/interconnected)
   - Guidance on when to use each section

### What Should Happen vs. What Currently Happens?

**Expected Behavior:**
- Task template includes explicit "Cross-Wiring" section
- Template provides clear guidance on bidirectional wiring
- Template includes relationship types and context
- Template references bidirectional wiring principle
- Users understand how to properly cross-wire interconnected tasks

**Current Behavior:**
- Task template has "Related Work" section with "Related Tasks" subsection
- No explicit guidance on bidirectional wiring
- No relationship types or context guidance
- No reference to bidirectional wiring principle
- Users may not understand how to properly cross-wire tasks

### When Does It Occur?

This feature is needed:
- **When creating new task documents** - Should include cross-wiring guidance
- **When linking related tasks** - Need clear pattern for bidirectional wiring
- **When contextualizing interconnected work** - Need relationship types and context

### Who is Affected?

**Primary Affected:**
- Developers/agents creating task documents
- Framework maintainers (template updates)
- Projects using the framework (cross-wiring patterns)

**Secondary Affected:**
- Intake workflow (cross-wiring automation)
- Documentation consumers (understanding relationships)

---

## Problem / Anti-Pattern

- Task template lacks explicit cross-wiring guidance
- No emphasis on bidirectional wiring in template
- No relationship types or context guidance
- Users may create one-way links instead of bidirectional
- Interconnected tasks may not be properly contextualized

## Scope Analysis

**Problem Domain:** Kanban Template, Task Documentation, Cross-Wiring Patterns  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Backend/API (template definition)
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [x] Documentation (Task template, cross-wiring guide)
- [ ] Testing
- [x] Other: Bidirectional wiring principle integration

**Estimated Complexity:**
- [x] Simple (1-3 days)
- [ ] Medium (1 week)
- [ ] Complex (2+ weeks)
- [ ] Very Complex (1+ month)

## Use Cases

**Primary Use Case:**
1. Developer creates Task E9:S01:T08 (Repository Story Abstract Space Contradiction)
2. Developer identifies related tasks: E9:S01:T01-T07 (other gap analysis tasks)
3. Developer adds cross-wiring section to T08:
   - Links to T01-T07 with relationship types
   - Ensures bidirectional links (T01-T07 link back to T08)
   - Provides context for why tasks are related

**Additional Use Cases:**
- Cross-wiring tasks that complement each other
- Cross-wiring tasks that coordinate with each other
- Cross-wiring tasks that inform each other
- Cross-wiring tasks across different epics/stories
