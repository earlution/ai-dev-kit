# Bug Report: Missing Implementation Cycle Workflow (ICW)

**Type:** Bug Report (BR)  
**Submitted:** 2026-03-12  
**Submitted By:** earlution (project maintainer)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** PENDING  
**GitHub Issue:** #22

---

## Summary

The Implementation Cycle Workflow (ICW) is missing from the workflow management framework package, despite being referenced as part of the AI Dev Kit workflow system. The ICW should be available alongside other standard workflows (Release, Refactor, Testing, Migration).

---

## Description

### What is the Bug?

The Implementation Cycle Workflow (ICW) is not included in the workflow management framework package and is not available as a standard workflow type in the workflow generator.

**Expected Behavior:**
- ICW should be included as `workflows/implementation-cycle-workflow.yaml` in the framework package
- ICW should be available as a standard workflow type in the workflow generator
- ICW should have documented implementation guide following agent-driven execution pattern

**Actual Behavior:**
- Only 5 workflows are installed: release-workflow.yaml, refactor-workflow.yaml, testing-workflow.yaml, migration-workflow.yaml, package-version-workflow.yaml
- ICW is missing from the framework package
- Workflow generator does not support `implementation-cycle` type
- Users cannot execute implementation cycle workflows as intended

### Root Cause

1. **Missing Workflow File:** No `implementation-cycle-workflow.yaml` in framework package
2. **Incomplete Generator Support:** Workflow generator lacks `implementation-cycle` type
3. **Documentation Gap:** No ICW execution guide following existing patterns
4. **Package List Incomplete:** ICW not included in framework documentation

---

## Environment

- **AI Dev Kit Version:** v0.9.4.1+1 (from submodule)
- **Installation Method:** Git submodule + pip install
- **Project:** XOforge (earlution/xoforge)
- **Python Version:** 3.x
- **OS:** macOS

---

## Impact

**Primary Impact:**
- Users cannot execute implementation cycle workflows as intended by framework design
- Limits workflow management capabilities
- Forces users to create custom workflows or use inappropriate existing workflows

**Secondary Impact:**
- Incomplete framework offering
- Poor user experience for implementation workflows
- Workarounds required for standard functionality

---

## Evidence

### Current Workflows Installed
```bash
$ ls frameworks/workflow-mgmt/workflows/
migration-workflow.yaml
package-version-workflow.yaml  
refactor-workflow.yaml
release-workflow.yaml
testing-workflow.yaml
```

### Workflow Generator Types
Available types from `scripts/README-workflow-generator.md`:
- `refactor` - Code refactoring workflows
- `migration` - Migration workflows (code, data, infrastructure)  
- `testing` - Testing workflows
- `custom` - Custom workflow with basic structure

**Missing:** `implementation-cycle` type

---

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Add ICW Workflow File
Create `workflows/implementation-cycle-workflow.yaml` following agent-driven execution pattern:

```yaml
name: Implementation Cycle Workflow
version: 1.0.0
type: implementation-cycle
description: Systematic implementation workflow for task execution using the agent-driven pattern

steps:
  - id: step-1
    name: Analyze Requirements
    type: analysis
    handler: implementation.analyze_requirements
    
  - id: step-2  
    name: Plan Implementation
    type: planning
    handler: implementation.plan_approach
    
  - id: step-3
    name: Execute Implementation  
    type: execution
    handler: implementation.execute
    
  - id: step-4
    name: Validate Results
    type: validation
    handler: implementation.validate
    
  - id: step-5
    name: Document Outcomes
    type: documentation
    handler: implementation.document
```

### 2. Update Workflow Generator
Add `implementation-cycle` as a workflow type in `generate_workflow.py`

### 3. Add Documentation
Create ICW execution guide following existing patterns

### 4. Update Package List
Include ICW in framework documentation

---

## Workaround

Users can create a custom ICW using the workflow generator:

```bash
python frameworks/workflow-mgmt/scripts/generate_workflow.py \
  --type custom \
  --name "Implementation Cycle Workflow" \
  --steps analysis planning execution validation documentation \
  --output implementation-cycle-workflow.yaml
```

However, this should not be necessary for a standard workflow type.

---

## Files to Check/Update

1. `frameworks/workflow-mgmt/workflows/` - Add ICW workflow file
2. `frameworks/workflow-mgmt/scripts/generate_workflow.py` - Add ICW type
3. `frameworks/workflow-mgmt/README.md` - Update workflow list
4. Documentation files referencing available workflows

---

## Testing Requirements

After fixing:
1. Verify ICW workflow file exists and is valid YAML
2. Test workflow generator with `--type implementation-cycle`
3. Execute ICW over a test task
4. Verify agent-driven execution pattern works correctly

---

## Additional Context

This issue was discovered when trying to execute "ICW (Implementation Cycle Workflow) over E01:S07:T01" for repository maintenance. The ICW is referenced as a standard workflow type but is not actually included in the framework package.

The missing ICW limits the framework's completeness and forces users to either:
1. Use inappropriate existing workflows (e.g., Refactor for implementation)
2. Create custom workflows for a standard pattern
3. File issues and wait for fixes

---

## Resolution Requirements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ ICW workflow file created and valid YAML
2. ✅ Workflow generator supports `implementation-cycle` type
3. ✅ ICW execution guide documented
4. ✅ Framework documentation updated
5. ✅ Testing validates complete functionality

**Priority:** HIGH - This issue blocks proper execution of implementation workflows that should be standard in the AI Dev Kit framework.
