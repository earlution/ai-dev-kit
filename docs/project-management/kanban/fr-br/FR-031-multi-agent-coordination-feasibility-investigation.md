# Feature Request: Multi-Agent Coordination Feasibility Investigation

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2026-01-14  
**Submitted By:** AI Agent (ai-dev-kit)  
**Priority:** C (Could Have)  
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**GitHub Issue:** [TBD]  
**Version:** v0.5.1.31+0 (migrated from v0.5.0.31+0)

---

## Summary

Investigate the feasibility of incorporating multi-agent coordination patterns (planners/workers architecture, hierarchical task distribution, long-running autonomous agents) into ai-dev-kit workflows and frameworks, based on research from Cursor's scaling experiments with hundreds of concurrent agents.

---

## Description

### What Functionality is Desired?

**Investigation Scope:**
1. **Multi-Agent Architecture Patterns:** Evaluate planner/worker separation, hierarchical task distribution, and role specialization
2. **Long-Running Agent Capabilities:** Assess feasibility of agents running autonomously for extended periods (days/weeks)
3. **Coordination Mechanisms:** Investigate task distribution, conflict resolution, and state management for concurrent agents
4. **Model Selection Strategies:** Evaluate different AI models for different roles (planners vs workers vs judges)
5. **Prompt Engineering Patterns:** Research effective prompting strategies for multi-agent coordination
6. **Scalability Analysis:** Understand limits and bottlenecks when scaling to dozens or hundreds of agents
7. **Integration Points:** Identify where multi-agent patterns could enhance existing workflows (RW, UKW, PVW, CMW)

**Key Research Questions:**
- Can planner/worker architecture improve workflow execution efficiency?
- What coordination mechanisms work best for agent-to-agent communication?
- How do we prevent agent drift and tunnel vision in long-running tasks?
- What's the optimal balance between structure and flexibility?
- How can we apply "simpler is better" principles to agent coordination?

### What Problem Does This Solve?

**Current Limitations:**
- **Single-Agent Bottlenecks:** Current workflows (RW, UKW, etc.) run sequentially with a single agent
- **Limited Parallelization:** Complex tasks can't be broken down and executed in parallel
- **Manual Coordination:** Human intervention required for complex multi-step workflows
- **No Task Specialization:** Same agent handles planning, execution, and validation
- **Scale Limitations:** Difficult to scale workflows to handle very large projects or multiple concurrent tasks

**Potential Benefits:**
- **Parallel Execution:** Multiple agents working on different aspects simultaneously
- **Specialized Roles:** Agents optimized for specific tasks (planning, execution, validation)
- **Long-Running Capability:** Agents that can work autonomously for extended periods
- **Better Coordination:** Hierarchical task distribution and conflict resolution
- **Scalability:** Ability to scale workflows to handle larger projects

### What is the Use Case?

**Use Case A: Parallel Workflow Execution**
A complex release workflow could have multiple agents working in parallel: one agent updating changelogs, another updating kanban docs, another running validators, all coordinated by a planner agent.

**Use Case B: Large-Scale Refactoring**
A major refactoring task could be broken down by a planner agent into hundreds of sub-tasks, distributed to worker agents, with progress tracked and conflicts resolved automatically.

**Use Case C: Multi-Project Coordination**
Multiple projects could have agents working on different tasks simultaneously, with a central planner coordinating cross-project dependencies.

**Use Case D: Long-Running Maintenance**
Automated maintenance tasks (documentation updates, dependency management, code quality improvements) could run continuously with agents picking up tasks as they become available.

**Use Case E: Intelligent Task Splitting**
Complex tasks could be automatically decomposed by planner agents into smaller, parallelizable sub-tasks, then distributed to worker agents.

### Who Would Benefit from This Feature?

**Primary Beneficiaries:**
- Projects with large codebases requiring extensive maintenance
- Teams managing multiple projects simultaneously
- Workflows that could benefit from parallel execution
- Projects requiring long-running automated tasks
- Developers seeking to reduce manual coordination overhead

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Planner/Worker Architecture

**Research Questions:**
- How does planner/worker separation improve coordination vs flat structure?
- What makes a good planner agent vs a good worker agent?
- How do sub-planners work for recursive task decomposition?
- What's the optimal ratio of planners to workers?

**Key Insights from Source:**
- Planners continuously explore codebase and create tasks
- Workers focus entirely on completing assigned tasks
- Judge agent determines whether to continue each cycle
- This solved coordination problems and enabled scaling to large projects

### 2. Coordination Mechanisms

**Research Questions:**
- Why did locking mechanisms fail? (held too long, bottlenecks, brittleness)
- How does optimistic concurrency control work for agents?
- What coordination mechanisms avoid bottlenecks while preventing conflicts?
- How do agents handle shared state and task queues?

**Key Insights from Source:**
- Locking mechanisms became bottlenecks (20 agents → 2-3 effective throughput)
- System was brittle: agents failed while holding locks, acquired locks incorrectly
- Optimistic concurrency control was simpler and more robust
- Too little structure → conflicts, duplication, drift
- Too much structure → fragility

### 3. Model Selection

**Research Questions:**
- Which models work best for planners vs workers vs judges?
- How do different models handle long-running tasks?
- What model characteristics matter for extended autonomous work?

**Key Insights from Source:**
- GPT-5.2 better for extended autonomous work (focus, avoiding drift, precision)
- Opus 4.5 stops earlier, takes shortcuts, yields control quickly
- GPT-5.2 better planner than GPT-5.1-codex (despite latter being coding-specific)
- Use model best suited for each role, not one universal model

### 4. Prompt Engineering

**Research Questions:**
- What prompt patterns enable good coordination?
- How do prompts prevent pathological behaviors?
- What prompts maintain focus over long periods?

**Key Insights from Source:**
- Prompts matter more than harness and models
- Extensive experimentation required for coordination, avoiding pathologies, maintaining focus
- System behavior heavily depends on how agents are prompted

### 5. Simplicity Principles

**Research Questions:**
- What complexity can be removed rather than added?
- How do we avoid over-engineering coordination?
- What's the minimal viable coordination mechanism?

**Key Insights from Source:**
- Improvements came from removing complexity, not adding it
- Integrator role created bottlenecks; workers handled conflicts themselves
- Best system simpler than expected
- Right amount of structure is in the middle (not too little, not too much)

### 6. Long-Running Capabilities

**Research Questions:**
- How do agents maintain context over days/weeks?
- What mechanisms prevent drift and tunnel vision?
- How do periodic fresh starts work?

**Key Insights from Source:**
- Agents ran for close to a week on browser project (1M+ LoC, 1000 files)
- Hundreds of workers run concurrently with minimal conflicts
- Still need periodic fresh starts to combat drift and tunnel vision
- Agents occasionally run for far too long (needs improvement)

### 7. Integration Points

**Research Questions:**
- Where in RW could planner/worker pattern help?
- Could UKW benefit from parallel task updates?
- How could PVW use multi-agent coordination?
- What CMW operations could be parallelized?

**Potential Integration Points:**
- **RW Step 2 (Bump Version):** Could parallelize package version bumps (PVW)
- **RW Step 3 (Create Changelog):** Could parallelize detailed changelog creation
- **RW Step 7 (Update Kanban):** Could parallelize epic/story/task updates
- **UKW:** Could parallelize task/story/epic document updates
- **CMW:** Could parallelize changelog archival and deduplication
- **Validation:** Could parallelize multiple validators
