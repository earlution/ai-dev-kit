# Bug Report: UKW Board Disorganization

**Type:** Bug Report (BR)  
**Submitted:** 2026-01-16  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** PENDING  
**GitHub Issue:** [TBD]  
**Version:** [TBD]

---

## Summary

UKW (Update Kanban Workflow) does not perform as expected. After running UKW, the Kanban board is disorganized with epics out of order.

**Note (SoP Compliance):** This BR focuses on the **bug** (epic ordering disorganization). The **enhancements** (priority assignment, use case flags, syntax parser, granular control) are documented in a separate Feature Request (FR-034) to maintain clear separation of concerns, following best practices for mixed-scope documents. See "Related Work" section for link to FR-034.

## Description

### Problem Statement

**Issue: Epic Ordering Disorganization**
After running UKW, the Kanban board's Epics section is not properly ordered. Current order observed:
- Epic 1, 2, 3, 4 (correct)
- Epic 21 (should be after Epic 9)
- Epic 5, 6 (should be after Epic 4)
- Epic 9 (should be after Epic 8)
- Epic 7, 8 (should be after Epic 6)
- Epic 24 (correct at end)

**Expected Order:** E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9, E21, E24

---

## Affected Component

**Primary Component:** Update Kanban Workflow (UKW)  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Workflow execution
- [x] Kanban board organization

**Root Cause (if known):**
- UKW Step 6 (Update Kanban Board) does not sort epics/stories/tasks numerically before writing to board

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run UKW workflow: Type "UKW" in Cursor
2. UKW executes all steps (Tasks → Stories → Epics → Board)
3. Check Kanban board (`docs/project-management/kanban/kanban-board.md`)
4. **Observed:** Epics are out of order (E1-4, E21, E5-6, E9, E7-8, E24)
5. **Expected:** Epics should be in numerical order (E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9, E21, E24)

## Environment

**Environment:** Development  
**Version:** v0.6.6.8+21  
**Workflow:** Update Kanban Workflow (UKW)  
**Component:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/update-kanban-workflow.yaml`

---

## Impact

**User Impact:**
- [x] High - Major functionality broken
  - Kanban board is disorganized and difficult to navigate
  - Users cannot easily find epics when they are out of order

**Business Impact:**
- Reduced usability of project management system
- Disorganized board makes it difficult to understand project structure
- Poor user experience reflects negatively on project quality

**Workaround:**
- Manually sort epics/stories/tasks in board
- Not scalable or sustainable

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Fix Requirements)

- [ ] **Criterion 1:** Epics are sorted numerically in board (E1, E2, E3, ...)
- [ ] **Criterion 2:** Stories are sorted numerically within epic sections
- [ ] **Criterion 3:** Tasks are sorted numerically within story sections
- [ ] **Criterion 4:** Epic/story documents have sorted checklists

**Verification Method:**
- [x] Test suite execution
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Both

**Fix Verification Status:**
- [ ] Verified (test suite passed / manual test passed)
- [ ] Attempted Fix (pending verification)

## Notes

**SoP Compliance:**
This BR was split from a mixed-scope document following the Standard Operating Procedure for handling mixed BR/FR scope. The enhancement content (use case flags, syntax parser, granular control) has been moved to FR-034 to maintain clear separation of concerns.

**Current UKW Behavior:**
- UKW runs as a monolithic workflow
- All steps execute regardless of need
- Sorting logic is missing or incomplete

**Expected Fix Behavior:**
- UKW should sort epics/stories/tasks numerically
- Sorting should be reliable and consistent
