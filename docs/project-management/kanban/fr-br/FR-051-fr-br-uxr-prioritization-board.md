# FR-051 – FR/BR/UXR Prioritization Board

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium  
**Created:** 2026-03-09  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-09  
**Version:** v0.6.7.107+1  
**Code:** FR-051  
**Implementing Task:** [E6:S06:T01](../epics/Epic-6/Story-006-feature-requests/T01-fr-br-uxr-prioritization-board.md)

## Problem Statement

The AI Dev Kit project currently has **no centralized board for prioritizing open FRs (Feature Requests), BRs (Bug Reports), and UXRs (User Experience Research items)**. While the Kanban board effectively manages MoSCOW-prioritized tasks, there's no equivalent system for managing the intake and prioritization of FRs, BRs, and UXRs.

**Current Issues:**

- **No visibility** into FR/BR/UXR priorities and status
- **No systematic approach** to prioritizing which FRs/BRs/UXRs to work on next
- **No tracking mechanism** for FR/BR/UXR completion and historical reference
- **Scattered management** across individual files without centralized oversight
- **No completion tracking** similar to kanban-completed.md for finished FR/BR/UXRs

---

## Proposed Solution

Create an **FR/BR/UXR Prioritization Board** with identical responsibility structure to the Kanban board, specifically for managing open FRs, BRs, and UXRs.

### Core Components

1. **Main Board (`fr-br-uxr-board.md`)**
   - Prioritized list of open FRs, BRs, and UXRs
   - Status tracking (TODO, IN PROGRESS, UNDER REVIEW, etc.)
   - Priority levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Links to individual FR/BR/UXR documents

2. **Completed Board (`fr-br-uxr-completed.md`)**
   - Historical tracking of completed FR/BR/UXRs
   - Completion dates and version markers
   - Categorized by type (FR, BR, UXR)
   - Reference to associated tasks that implemented them

3. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Links to individual FR/BR/UXR documents in `/fr-br/` directory
   - Cross-references to associated Kanban tasks
   - Integration with intake workflow for automatic updates

### Board Structure

#### Main Board Sections

- **Critical Priority** - Urgent FRs/BRs/UXRs requiring immediate attention
- **High Priority** - Important items that should be addressed soon
- **Medium Priority** - Standard priority items
- **Low Priority** - Nice-to-have items
- **Under Review** - Items currently being evaluated or worked on
- **Awaiting Information** - Items blocked by missing information

#### Completed Board Sections

- **Completed Feature Requests** - Implemented features
- **Resolved Bug Reports** - Fixed bugs
- **Completed User Experience Research** - Finished research initiatives

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. ✅ **Main Board Created** - Functional prioritization board for FR/BR/UXRs
2. ✅ **Completed Board Created** - Historical tracking for finished items
3. ✅ **Priority System** - Clear priority levels and status tracking
4. ✅ **Integration** - Links to existing FR/BR/UXR documents and Kanban tasks
5. ✅ **Automatic Updates** - Integration with intake workflow for board updates

### Quality Requirements

1. ✅ **Identical Structure** - Same responsibility model as Kanban board
2. ✅ **Clear Prioritization** - Easy to understand priority system
3. ✅ **Comprehensive Tracking** - Complete lifecycle tracking from open to completed
4. ✅ **Historical Reference** - Easy lookup of completed items and their implementations

### Integration Requirements

1. ✅ **FR/BR/UXR Links** - Direct links to individual documents
2. ✅ **Kanban Integration** - Cross-references to associated tasks
3. ✅ **Intake Workflow** - Automatic board updates when new FR/BR/UXRs are created
4. ✅ **Completion Tracking** - Automatic updates when FR/BR/UXRs are completed

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Create

1. `docs/project-management/kanban/fr-br-uxr-board.md` - Main prioritization board
2. `docs/project-management/kanban/fr-br-uxr-completed.md` - Completed items tracking

### Files to Update

1. `kanban-board.md` - Add reference to FR/BR/UXR board
2. `kanban-board-guide.md` - Add FR/BR/UXR board documentation
3. Intake workflow - Add automatic board update functionality

### Integration Points

- **FR/BR/UXR Documents** - Link to individual documents in `/fr-br/` directory
- **Kanban Tasks** - Cross-reference to tasks implementing FR/BR/UXRs
- **Intake Workflow** - Automatic board population and updates
- **Release Workflow** - Update completed board when FR/BR/UXRs are released

---

## Benefits

### Immediate Benefits

- **Visibility** - Clear view of all FR/BR/UXR priorities and status
- **Prioritization** - Systematic approach to deciding what to work on next
- **Tracking** - Complete lifecycle tracking from intake to completion
- **Historical Reference** - Easy lookup of completed items and their implementations

### Long-term Benefits

- **Better Planning** - Data-driven approach to FR/BR/UXR prioritization
- **Improved Communication** - Clear status visibility for all stakeholders
- **Historical Analysis** - Ability to analyze FR/BR/UXR completion patterns
- **Process Improvement** - Foundation for continuous improvement of intake process

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Low Risk

- **Well-defined scope** - Clear requirements based on existing Kanban board pattern
- **Proven approach** - Using identical structure to successful Kanban board
- **Incremental implementation** - Can start with basic functionality and enhance over time

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Follow existing patterns** - Use Kanban board structure as proven template
- **Gradual rollout** - Start with basic functionality, add features as needed
- **Continuous improvement** - Gather feedback and refine based on usage

---

## Dependencies

### Required Dependencies

- Existing FR/BR/UXR documents in `/fr-br/` directory
- Current Kanban board structure and patterns
- Intake workflow for automatic updates

### Optional Dependencies

- Integration with GitHub Issues for external FR/BR/UXR tracking
- Automated priority scoring based on impact and effort
- Dashboard visualization of FR/BR/UXR metrics

---

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)

- Create main FR/BR/UXR board structure
- Create completed board structure
- Populate with existing open FR/BR/UXRs
- Set up basic priority and status tracking

### Phase 2: Integration (Day 2)

- Add links to individual FR/BR/UXR documents
- Cross-reference with existing Kanban tasks
- Update Kanban board documentation
- Test basic functionality

### Phase 3: Automation (Day 3)

- Integrate with intake workflow for automatic updates
- Implement completion tracking
- Final testing and validation

---

**Success Metric:** Fully functional FR/BR/UXR prioritization board with identical responsibility structure to Kanban board, providing clear visibility and systematic prioritization of all open FRs, BRs, and UXRs.

---

*This FR establishes the foundation for systematic FR/BR/UXR management, bringing the same level of organization and visibility to the intake process that the Kanban board provides to task execution.*
