# Feature Request: Changelog Management and Archival Workflow

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-21  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** PENDING  

---

## Summary

Create a comprehensive changelog management and archival workflow to maintain a sustainable, well-organized changelog as the project grows. The workflow will include automated archival policies, validation, and maintenance procedures to prevent the changelog from becoming unmanageable (currently ~9,500 lines and growing).

---

## Problem Statement

The current `CHANGELOG.md` has grown to approximately **9,500 lines**, making it:
- **Unsustainable** for manual maintenance
- **Difficult to navigate** for users and developers
- **Prone to ordering violations** and duplicate entries
- **Time-consuming** to validate and maintain
- **Inefficient** for finding recent changes vs. historical changes

Manual management of such a large changelog violates best practices and creates maintenance burden.

---

## Research Findings: Best Practices for Changelog Management and Archival

Based on industry research into Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for changelog management:

### 1. **Clear Version Control and Versioning Schemes**

- Implement consistent versioning (e.g., semantic versioning) to track changes systematically
- Provides clear audit trail and document iteration history
- Prevents confusion over document versions
- **Source:** [docsie.io](https://www.docsie.io/blog/glossary/documentation-versioning/)

### 2. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**

Develop detailed SOPs outlining:
- Steps for documenting, reviewing, and approving changelog entries
- Processes for creating, updating, reviewing, and archiving changelogs
- Ensures uniformity and compliance across the organization
- Assigns authors and approvers, maintains version control
- **Source:** [hms.harvard.edu](https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/assets/Sites/OHRA/files/Binder1.pdf)

### 3. **Automation Tools and Workflows**

- Leverage automation tools to streamline changelog creation and management
- Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to automatically generate logs from commit messages
- Reduces manual errors and keeps changelogs updated efficiently
- Tools like Process Street and CheckFlow allow for documentation, automation, and enforcement of SOPs

### 5. **Categorization and Prioritization**

- Organize changelog entries into categories (e.g., new features, improvements, bug fixes)
- Prioritize updates based on their impact
- Helps users quickly identify significant changes
- **Source:** [feedbear.com](https://www.feedbear.com/blog/how-to-manage-your-product-changelog-effectively/)

### 6. **Systematic Archival Strategy**

- Develop a system for archiving old changelogs to keep current documentation uncluttered
- Preserve historical records in an accessible archive
- Maintain centralized repository for all changelog entries
- Archive should be easily accessible for reference and compliance purposes
- Supports transparency and aids in historical tracking
- **Source:** [receiptmake.com](https://receiptmake.com/blog/best-practices-for-document-management)

### 7. **Maintain Comprehensive Change Documentation**

- Document not only what changed but also why changes were made and how they impact users
- Detailed changelogs with rationale and impact assessments provide valuable context
- Use simple language to ensure users can easily understand updates
- **Source:** [docsie.io](https://www.docsie.io/blog/glossary/documentation-versioning/), [feedbear.com](https://www.feedbear.com/blog/how-to-manage-your-product-changelog-effectively/)

### 8. **Regular Update Schedules**

- Establish consistent schedule for releasing updates and corresponding changelogs
- Sets clear expectations for users and demonstrates ongoing commitment
- Helps maintain user engagement and trust

## Description

### What is the Feature?

A comprehensive changelog management and archival workflow that includes:

1. **Changelog Management Workflow (CMW):**
   - Automated validation of changelog format and ordering
   - Detection and removal of duplicate entries
   - Automated ordering based on version numbers (newest first)
   - Regular review and maintenance cycles

2. **Changelog Archival Policy:**
   - Define archival criteria (e.g., entries older than X months, or CHANGELOG.md exceeding Y lines)
   - Automated archival process that moves old entries to archive directory
   - Maintains detailed changelog archive with preserved historical context
   - Archive remains accessible and searchable

3. **Automated Maintenance:**
   - Integration with Release Workflow (RW) to ensure changelog updates are validated
   - Pre-commit validation to prevent ordering violations and duplicates
   - Automated cleanup of orphaned sections and malformed entries

4. **SOPs and Documentation:**
   - Standard Operating Procedures for changelog management
   - Guidelines for entry format, categorization, and prioritization
   - Training materials for team members
   - Integration with existing workflow documentation

### What Should Happen vs. What Currently Happens?

**Expected Behavior:**
- Changelog management is automated and sustainable
- `CHANGELOG.md` remains manageable in size (e.g., max 500-1000 lines)
- Old entries automatically archived to `docs/changelog-and-release-notes/changelog-archive/CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`
- Archival policy defined and enforced (e.g., entries older than 12 months, or main changelog exceeding 1000 lines)
- Validation prevents ordering violations and duplicates before commit
- Changelog Management Workflow (CMW) runs periodically or on-demand to maintain changelog health
- Historical entries remain accessible in archive for reference
- Clear separation between "recent changes" (main changelog) and "historical record" (archive)

**Current Behavior:**
- Manual changelog management (unsustainable at ~9,500 lines)
- No automated archival process
- Ordering violations and duplicates require manual fixes
- No defined archival policy or criteria
- No systematic review or maintenance workflow
- All entries kept in single file regardless of age or relevance

### When Does It Occur?

This feature is needed:
- **Immediately:** Current changelog is unmanageable and requires immediate archival
- **Ongoing:** Regular maintenance workflow to prevent future bloat
- **During RW:** Integration with Release Workflow to validate new entries
- **Periodically:** Scheduled reviews and archival runs (e.g., monthly or quarterly)

---

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Changelog Management Workflow (CMW)

Create a new workflow similar to UKW (Update Kanban Workflow) but focused on changelog maintenance:

- **Trigger:** "CMW" or "cmw" (case-insensitive), or scheduled (e.g., monthly)
- **Steps:**
  1. Analyze current changelog state (size, ordering, duplicates)
  2. Validate changelog format and ordering
  3. Detect and report duplicates
  4. Identify entries eligible for archival (based on archival policy)
  5. Archive old entries to archive file
  6. Validate remaining changelog entries
  7. Stage and commit changes
  8. Report summary of maintenance actions

### 2. Archival Policy

Define clear criteria for archival:
- **Size-based:** Archive when `CHANGELOG.md` exceeds N lines (e.g., 1000 lines)
- **Time-based:** Archive entries older than X months (e.g., 12 months)
- **Version-based:** Keep only last N major versions in main changelog (e.g., last 50 releases)
- **Hybrid:** Combination of criteria (e.g., archive entries older than 6 months OR when main changelog exceeds 1000 lines)

**Archive Structure:**
- Main changelog: `CHANGELOG.md` (recent entries, manageable size)
- Archive: `docs/changelog-and-release-notes/changelog-archive/CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md` (historical entries)
- Detailed changelogs: Individual files remain in `docs/changelog-and-release-notes/changelog-archive/CHANGELOG_v{version}.md`

### 3. Integration with Release Workflow (RW)

Enhance RW to include changelog validation:
- **RW Step 9:** Run changelog validators (already exists)
- **RW Step 9.5:** Run CMW if changelog size exceeds threshold (new)
- **Pre-commit:** Validate changelog format, ordering, duplicates before commit

### 4. SOPs and Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation:
- `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/changelog-management-policy.md` - Changelog management policy
- `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/changelog-archival-policy.md` - Archival policy and criteria
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/docs/documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/changelog-management-workflow-agent-execution.md` - CMW execution guide
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/changelog-management-workflow.yaml` - CMW workflow definition

---

## Use Cases

1. **Immediate Archival:**
   - User runs CMW to archive old entries from current 9,500-line changelog
   - CMW moves entries older than 12 months to archive
   - Main changelog reduced to manageable size (~500-1000 lines)

2. **Ongoing Maintenance:**
   - CMW runs monthly to validate and maintain changelog
   - Detects and removes duplicates
   - Validates ordering compliance
   - Archives entries meeting archival criteria

3. **RW Integration:**
   - RW Step 9.5 detects changelog exceeds 1000 lines
   - Automatically triggers CMW archival process
   - Ensures main changelog stays manageable

4. **Historical Reference:**
   - Developer needs to find change from 18 months ago
   - Searches `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md` for historical entry
   - Finds detailed changelog in archive directory
