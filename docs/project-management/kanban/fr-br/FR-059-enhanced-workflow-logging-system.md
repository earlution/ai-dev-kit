# FR-059: Enhanced Workflow Logging System with Forensic Capabilities and Rollback Hardening

**FR ID:** FR-059  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Created:** 2026-03-17  
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-17  

---

## Problem Statement

Current workflow execution lacks comprehensive forensic logging capabilities needed for effective troubleshooting and rollback operations. The existing logging system only captures high-level workflow status without breaking down atomic commands, preserving I/O for diagnosis, or providing rollback-hardening features.

Key gaps identified:

- No atomic command decomposition in logs
- Missing I/O preservation for forensic analysis
- No TTL/lifecycle metadata for automatic housekeeping
- Rollback capabilities are placeholder implementations
- Logs not integrated with documentation housekeeping policies

---

## Goals

- **Atomic Logging**: Every command/script decomposed to individual operations with full I/O capture
- **Forensic Readiness**: Structured logs enable rapid diagnosis and recovery from workflow failures
- **Rollback Hardening**: Process state snapshots enable deterministic rollback to consistent checkpoints
- **Housekeeping Integration**: Logs wired into documentation lifecycle with automatic TTL-based cleanup
- **Documentation Policy Compliance**: All workflow logs managed under Documentation Agent jurisdiction

---

## Proposed Scope

### **Enhanced Logging Infrastructure**

- **Atomic Command Breakdown**: Every subprocess call logged individually with:
  - Microsecond timestamps
  - Full command arguments
  - Input/output preservation
  - Execution time measurement
  - Error codes and stderr capture

- **Structured Log Format**: JSON-structured logs with metadata headers:
  - TTL=7 days for automatic cleanup
  - `lifecycle: ephemeral`
  - `housekeeping_policy: auto-delete`
  - Version tracking and forensic markers

- **Multi-level Logging**:
  - Workflow-level: High-level execution status
  - Command-level: Atomic operations with I/O
  - State-level: Process snapshots for rollback

### **Rollback Hardening**

- **Checkpoint Creation**: Automatic state snapshots before/after critical operations
- **Deterministic Rollback**: Ability to restore to any checkpoint with conflict resolution
- **Failure Classification**: Intelligent failure type detection (transient/critical/ambiguous)
- **Recovery Orchestration**: Automated recovery workflows with human oversight options

### **Documentation Integration**

- **Agent Jurisdiction**: Documentation Agent owns all maintenance logs with lifecycle management
- **Housekeeping Automation**: TTL enforcement prevents log accumulation
- **Policy Compliance**: All logs follow documentation lifecycle policies
- **Audit Trail**: Complete temporal tracking of log creation/deletion

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### **Functional Requirements**

- [ ] **Atomic Logging**: Every workflow command logged individually with full I/O preservation
- [ ] **Forensic Capability**: Logs enable diagnosis of any workflow failure within 5 minutes
- [ ] **Rollback Hardening**: Failed workflows can be deterministically rolled back to stable checkpoints
- [ ] **TTL Integration**: Logs automatically deleted after 7-day TTL
- [ ] **Documentation Policy**: Logs fully integrated with Documentation Agent lifecycle management

### **Performance Requirements**

- [ ] **Minimal Overhead**: Logging adds &lt;5% execution time overhead
- [ ] **Storage Efficient**: Logs compressed and optimized for forensic analysis
- [ ] **Scalable**: System handles 100+ concurrent workflow executions

### **Integration Requirements**

- [ ] **Workflow Executor**: Enhanced with forensic logging capabilities
- [ ] **Documentation Agent**: Jurisdiction extended to maintenance logs
- [ ] **Housekeeping**: Automatic TTL enforcement for workflow logs
- [ ] **Validation**: Log format validation integrated into CI pipeline

---

## Dependencies

- **FR-058**: Markdown Maintenance Workflow (for log formatting consistency)
- **Workflow Executor**: Current implementation in `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/workflow_executor.py`
- **Documentation Agent**: Lifecycle management capabilities
- **Housekeeping Process**: TTL enforcement mechanisms

---

## Implementation Approach

### **Phase 1: Core Logging Infrastructure**

- Enhance `WorkflowExecutor` with atomic command logging
- Create log template with TTL/lifecycle metadata
- Implement structured JSON logging format

### **Phase 2: Rollback Hardening**

- Implement checkpoint creation/restoration
- Add failure type classification
- Create recovery orchestration logic

### **Phase 3: Documentation Integration**

- Update Documentation Agent jurisdiction
- Wire logs into housekeeping process
- Add validation for log format compliance

### **Phase 4: Testing and Validation**

- Comprehensive logging tests
- Rollback scenario validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Integration testing with housekeeping

---

## Success Metrics

### **Quantitative**

- **Diagnosis Time**: &lt;5 minutes for any workflow failure diagnosis
- **Rollback Success**: 100% success rate for deterministic rollbacks
- **Storage Growth**: &lt;10% monthly growth in log storage
- **Performance Impact**: &lt;5% execution time overhead

### **Qualitative**

- **Forensic Readiness**: Logs enable complete workflow state reconstruction
- **Recovery Confidence**: Operators can confidently rollback any failed workflow
- **Maintenance Burden**: Zero manual log management required
- **Audit Capability**: Complete temporal audit trail for all workflow executions

## Risk Assessment

### **High Risks**
- **Performance Impact**: Extensive logging could slow workflow execution
- **Storage Accumulation**: High-volume logs could exhaust storage before TTL cleanup
- **Complexity**: Enhanced logging system increases maintenance complexity

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Performance**: Asynchronous logging and selective detail levels
- **Storage**: Aggressive TTL enforcement and log compression
- **Complexity**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

## Open Questions

1. **TTL Duration**: Is 7 days appropriate, or should it be configurable per workflow type?
2. **Log Retention**: Should critical failure logs be retained longer than successful executions?
3. **Security**: Should logs containing sensitive data be encrypted or redacted?
4. **Integration**: How to handle logging for workflows not using the enhanced executor?
