# Bug Report: Apple SDK License Blocking Issue

**Type:** Bug Report (BR)  
**ID:** BR-040  
**Submitted:** 2026-03-10  
**Submitted By:** earlution  
**Priority:** TBD  
**Status:** NEW

---

## Summary

Investigate and resolve Apple SDK license blocking issue that prevents proper installation or usage of ai-dev-kit components on Apple platforms.

---

## Description

When attempting to install or use ai-dev-kit components on Apple platforms (macOS, iOS), users encounter blocking issues related to Apple SDK licenses that prevent proper functionality. This issue needs investigation to understand the root cause and implement appropriate solutions.

### Current Problem Statement

- **Platform Affected:** Apple platforms (macOS, iOS)
- **Issue Type:** SDK license blocking
- **Impact:** Prevents installation or usage of ai-dev-kit components
- **Severity:** TBD (needs investigation)

---

## Environment

### Affected Platforms
- **macOS:** All supported versions
- **iOS:** All supported versions (if applicable)

### ai-dev-kit Version
- **Version:** Latest (TBD)
- **Components:** All components that interact with Apple SDKs

### Apple SDK Versions
- **Xcode:** TBD (needs investigation)
- **iOS SDK:** TBD (needs investigation)
- **macOS SDK:** TBD (needs investigation)

---

## Reproduction Steps

### Steps to Reproduce
1. **Environment Setup:** Install ai-dev-kit on Apple platform
2. **Installation Attempt:** Run `ai-dev-kit install` or component-specific installation
3. **License Issue:** Encounter SDK license blocking error
4. **Failure:** Installation or usage fails due to license restrictions

### Expected Behavior
- ai-dev-kit should install and function properly on Apple platforms
- SDK license issues should be handled gracefully or avoided entirely

### Actual Behavior
- Installation or usage fails due to Apple SDK license blocking
- Error messages indicate license-related restrictions

---

## Error Details

### Error Messages
```
[TBD - Add actual error messages from investigation]
```

### Stack Traces
```
[TBD - Add stack traces from investigation]
```

### Log Files
- **Install Logs:** `logs/ai-dev-kit/install/install-*.log`
- **System Logs:** TBD
- **Xcode Logs:** TBD

---

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Problem Identification
- **Reproduce Issue:** Confirm the blocking issue on Apple platforms
- **Collect Evidence:** Gather error messages, logs, and system information
- **Identify Scope:** Determine which components are affected
- **Assess Impact:** Evaluate severity and user impact

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis
- **License Review:** Examine Apple SDK license requirements
- **Dependency Analysis:** Check which dependencies trigger license issues
- **Platform Specifics:** Identify Apple-specific licensing constraints
- **Compatibility Check:** Verify ai-dev-kit compatibility with Apple SDK requirements

### Phase 3: Solution Development
- **Workaround Options:** Identify potential workarounds or alternative approaches
- **License Compliance:** Ensure solutions comply with Apple SDK licensing
- **Implementation Strategy:** Develop implementation plan for resolution
- **Testing Strategy:** Create testing plan for Apple platforms

### Phase 4: Implementation and Validation
- **Implement Solution:** Apply the chosen resolution approach
- **Test Validation:** Verify solution works on affected Apple platforms
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure no regressions on other platforms
- **Documentation Update:** Update documentation with Apple platform specifics

---

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: License Compliance Fix
- **Approach:** Modify ai-dev-kit to comply with Apple SDK licensing requirements
- **Pros:** Proper long-term solution
- **Cons:** May require significant changes

### Option 2: Alternative Dependencies
- **Approach:** Replace Apple SDK dependencies with cross-platform alternatives
- **Pros:** Eliminates Apple-specific licensing issues
- **Cons:** May lose Apple-specific functionality

### Option 3: Conditional Installation
- **Approach:** Implement platform-specific installation logic
- **Pros:** Allows graceful handling of license issues
- **Cons:** May limit functionality on Apple platforms

### Option 4: User Guidance
- **Approach:** Provide clear guidance for Apple SDK license setup
- **Pros:** Minimal code changes
- **Cons:** Places burden on users
