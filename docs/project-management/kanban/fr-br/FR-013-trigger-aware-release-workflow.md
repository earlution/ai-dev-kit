# Feature Request: Trigger-Aware Release Workflow

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-10  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Severity:** N/A  
**Status:** PENDING  

---

## Summary

The RW needs to be trigger aware. It needs to be able to react to specified triggers, so that it can dynamically run sub-workflows, that would, presumably, produce a deliverable. The RW needs to be intelligent enough to know what to do with the deliverable.

---

## Description

### What is the Feature?

An intelligent, trigger-aware Release Workflow (RW) system that can:
- React to specified triggers
- Dynamically run sub-workflows based on triggers
- Process deliverables produced by sub-workflows
- Intelligently determine what to do with deliverables
- Chain workflows together to accomplish complex use cases

### What Should Happen vs. What Currently Happens?

**Expected Behavior:**
- RW detects a trigger condition (e.g., "commit includes FR/BR")
- RW intelligently determines which sub-workflow to run
- RW executes the sub-workflow
- Sub-workflow produces a deliverable (e.g., Kanban tasks)
- RW intelligently processes the deliverable:
  - Determines what the deliverable is
  - Determines what actions to take with the deliverable
  - Integrates the deliverable into the release process
  - Updates versioning, changelog, documentation as needed
- RW continues with normal release process, incorporating the deliverable

**Current Behavior:**
- RW is a linear, step-by-step process
- No trigger detection or reaction
- No dynamic sub-workflow execution
- No intelligent deliverable processing
- Manual intervention required for complex scenarios

### When Does It Occur?

This feature is needed whenever:
- RW needs to react to specific conditions (triggers)
- Complex use cases require multiple workflows
- Deliverables from sub-workflows need to be integrated
- Automated workflow chaining is required

### Who is Affected?

**Primary Affected:**
- Developers/agents using RW
- Workflow automation users
- Framework maintainers

**Secondary Affected:**
- Framework users (workflow capabilities)
- CI/CD systems (workflow integration)

---

## Use Cases

1. **FR/BR Commit Trigger:**
   - RW detects that commit includes FR or BR
   - RW triggers FR/BR to Kanban task creation workflow (FR-012)
   - Workflow creates Kanban tasks
   - RW processes the tasks as deliverables:
     - Updates Kanban board
     - Updates versioning
     - Updates changelog
     - Continues with release

2. **Complex Multi-Workflow Use Case:**
   - User requests complete use case (e.g., "implement FR-012 and create tasks")
   - RW intelligently determines:
     - What workflows need to run
     - In what order
     - What deliverables each produces
     - How to integrate deliverables
   - RW executes workflows in sequence
   - RW processes all deliverables intelligently
   - RW completes the full use case

3. **Conditional Workflow Execution:**
   - RW detects specific conditions (e.g., "epic template files changed")
   - RW triggers appropriate sub-workflow (e.g., template validation)
   - RW processes sub-workflow deliverables
   - RW continues with release

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Trigger Detection:**
   - Detect specified trigger conditions
   - Support multiple trigger types (commit patterns, file changes, manual triggers, etc.)
   - Support trigger conditions and logic

2. **Sub-Workflow Execution:**
   - Dynamically select and execute sub-workflows based on triggers
   - Support workflow parameters and configuration
   - Handle sub-workflow execution errors

3. **Deliverable Processing:**
   - Identify deliverables from sub-workflows
   - Understand deliverable type and content
   - Determine appropriate actions for deliverables
   - Integrate deliverables into release process

4. **Intelligent Decision Making:**
   - Understand context and requirements
   - Make intelligent decisions about workflow execution
   - Determine how to process deliverables
   - Handle complex multi-workflow scenarios

5. **Workflow Chaining:**
   - Chain multiple workflows together
   - Handle dependencies between workflows
   - Process deliverables from multiple workflows
   - Integrate all deliverables into final release

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Intelligence:**
   - Must be agentic (AI/LLM-powered)
   - Must understand context and make reasoned decisions
   - Must provide explanations for decisions

2. **Extensibility:**
   - Must support custom triggers
   - Must support custom sub-workflows
   - Must allow for workflow customization

3. **Reliability:**
   - Must handle sub-workflow failures gracefully
   - Must provide rollback capabilities
   - Must maintain workflow state

---

## Problems Solved

1. **Manual Workflow Orchestration:** Eliminates need for manual workflow coordination
2. **Complex Use Case Handling:** Enables automated handling of complex multi-workflow use cases
3. **Deliverable Integration:** Automates integration of sub-workflow deliverables
4. **Workflow Flexibility:** Enables dynamic, context-aware workflow execution
5. **Scalability:** Enables efficient handling of complex scenarios

---

## Design Considerations

### How Could This Be Achieved?

**Option 1: Trigger Registry System**
- Define trigger registry with trigger conditions and associated workflows
- RW checks triggers at key points in execution
- When trigger matches, execute associated workflow
- Process workflow deliverables intelligently

**Option 2: Agentic Workflow Orchestrator**
- AI/LLM analyzes current RW state and context
- Determines what workflows need to run
- Executes workflows dynamically
- Processes deliverables intelligently

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Trigger registry for common patterns
- Agentic orchestrator for complex scenarios
- Intelligent deliverable processing for all cases

### Deliverable Processing Intelligence

**How could we empower the RW to deliver the complete use case encompassed by this entire prompt?**

1. **Context Understanding:**
   - RW analyzes the full context (user request, current state, deliverables)
   - Understands what the complete use case requires
   - Determines what workflows need to run

2. **Workflow Planning:**
   - Plans workflow execution sequence
   - Identifies dependencies between workflows
   - Determines deliverable processing requirements

3. **Intelligent Execution:**
   - Executes workflows in correct order
   - Processes deliverables as they're produced
   - Integrates deliverables into release process

4. **Use Case Completion:**
   - Ensures all required work is completed
   - Validates deliverables meet requirements
   - Completes the full use case end-to-end

## Notes

This feature requires significant agentic intelligence to:
- Understand context and requirements
- Make intelligent decisions about workflow execution
- Process deliverables intelligently
- Handle complex multi-workflow scenarios

The design should consider:
- Trigger registry vs. agentic orchestrator vs. hybrid approach
- Deliverable processing intelligence
- Workflow chaining and dependency management
- Error handling and rollback capabilities
