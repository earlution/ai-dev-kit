# Feature Request: Implementation Planning Workflow (IPW)

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Identifier:** IPW (Implementation Planning Workflow)  
**Submitted:** 2026-02-22  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-02 — AC5 (retro wiring) and AC7 (validator script) completed; FR-042 acceptance criteria satisfied under **E5:S01:T42**.  
**Implementation Task:** [E5:S01:T42](../epics/Epic-5/Story-001-fr-repo/T42-implementation-planning-workflow-ipw.md)

---

## Summary

Define and implement an **Implementation Planning Workflow (IPW)** – a formal workflow for creating planning documents (spec, test design, implementation plan) before task implementation. IPW ensures planning artifacts are produced consistently and integrate with the Implementation Cycle (spec + TDD). **Critical:** The task doc and plan doc **must be bidirectionally wired** – the task doc must reference the plan doc (Input, References), and the plan doc must reference the task doc (Host Task). Both links are mandatory; a plan doc is not complete without them. Planning must not be ad hoc; it must be a repeatable, traceable workflow.

**Strategic consolidation:** The former **Implementation Cycle Workflow (ICW)**—three-phase specification / test design / implementation planning under the ICW name—is **merged into IPW**. **IPW** (`IPW` or `IPW E:S:T`) is the **canonical** user-facing planning workflow. ICW-specific packaging (e.g. `implementation-cycle-workflow`, `icw_handler.py`, Cursor **`ICW`** trigger) must be **deprecated, aliased to IPW, or documented as legacy** so there is only one planning workflow to learn and maintain. **RW** remains canonical for release; **implementation** follows the Implementation Cycle (TDD, etc.) guided by IPW artifacts, not by a second parallel “planning” workflow brand.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current Situation:**
- Two overlapping concepts exist for the same intent: **ICW** (FR-040, framework workflow + handler + **`ICW`** trigger) and **IPW** (this FR)—both target structured planning before implementation, which splits documentation and cognitive load
- Planning documents (spec/test/impl plans) are created informally and inconsistently
- No defined workflow for *when* or *how* to create a plan doc
- Plan docs are often created without being wired to their host task doc
- **Fundamental failure:** Plan docs exist with no cross-reference in the task doc, and no link back – breaks traceability and discoverability
- Implementation Cycle (Step 3: Spec & Test Creation) exists but lacks a formal planning workflow that produces a durable plan document

**Root Causes:**
- No workflow or SoP for implementation planning
- No enforcement of mandatory wiring at creation time
- Planning is treated as optional or implicit rather than a first-class workflow
- Gap between "ascertain spec, create tests" (Implementation Cycle) and producing a reusable plan document

**Impact:**
- Orphaned plan docs (exist but not discoverable from task)
- Inconsistent planning quality and completeness
- Violates bidirectional wiring principle
- Weakens traceability between planning and implementation
- Implementation Cycle Step 3 lacks a clear planning artifact

---

## Proposed Solution: Implementation Planning Workflow (IPW)

### 1. IPW Definition

**IPW** is the workflow for creating an **implementation plan document** before implementation begins. It sits between Task Creation (Implementation Cycle Step 2) and Specification & Test Creation (Step 3), and produces the planning artifact that guides Step 3 and Step 4.

**IPW Trigger:** User invokes **`IPW`** (or `IPW ExxSxxTxx`). This replaces the previous ad hoc instruction:
> "Plan ExxSxxTxx: Define spec, design tests, plan impl"

It also **replaces the `ICW` trigger for planning**: users and docs should prefer **`IPW`**; **`ICW`** may remain temporarily as an alias but must not define a divergent planning process.

**IPW Output:** A plan document containing:
- **Specification** – Functional and non-functional requirements, scope, boundaries
- **Test Design** – Test categories, test cases, test data strategy
- **Implementation Plan** – Phases, steps, dependency order, files to create/modify

### 2. Formalized IPW Steps (Ordered)

| Step | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **0** | Identify Host Task | Resolve E:S:T from user input or context; confirm task doc exists |
| **1** | Define Spec | Populate Spec section: Goal, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional (if applicable), Out of Scope |
| **2** | Design Tests | Populate Test Design: categories, test cases (TC/Name/Behavior), test data strategy |
| **3** | Plan Implementation | Populate Impl Plan: phases, steps, dependency order, files to create/modify |
| **4** | Create Plan Doc | Write plan doc using template; include header with Task ID, Host Task link |
| **5** | Wire to Host Task | Add plan doc to task doc Input and References; add Host Task in plan doc header |
| **6** | Validate | Confirm bidirectional wiring; confirm required sections present |

#### Mandatory Bidirectional Wiring

**Both directions MUST be wired – neither is optional.**

| Direction | Where | What to add |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Task doc → Plan doc** | Task doc **Input** | Link to plan doc (e.g. `[T07-planning-spec-tests-impl.md](T07-planning-spec-tests-impl.md)`) |
| **Task doc → Plan doc** | Task doc **References** | Same link |
| **Plan doc → Task doc** | Plan doc header | `**Host Task:** [T07-migrate-embedded-tasks-to-discrete-documents.md](T07-migrate-embedded-tasks-to-discrete-documents.md) (E4:S11:T07)` |

- **Task doc must link to plan doc** – Otherwise the plan is orphaned; developers cannot discover it from the task.
- **Plan doc must link to task doc** – Otherwise the plan lacks context; the host task cannot be identified.
- Wiring is **atomic**: both directions are completed in the same session. A plan doc is **not complete** until both links exist.

### 3. Plan Doc Template (Proposed)

**Header (required):**
- Task title (`E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}` – Planning: Spec, Tests, Implementation Plan)
- **Host Task:** relative path to the host task doc (`E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`) — link to the task markdown file (bidirectional wiring)
- Status
- Planning doc created date

**Sections (required):**
1. **Specification** – Goal, Functional Requirements (table: ID/Requirement/Source), Non-Functional (optional), Out of Scope
2. **Test Design** – Test Categories (table), Test Cases (table: TC/Name/Behavior), Test Data Strategy
3. **Implementation Plan** – Phases (table: Step/Action/Deliverable), Dependency Order, Files to Create/Modify
4. **Success/Verification Criteria** (optional but recommended)

### 4. Analysis of Past Planning Docs

**Examples analyzed:** T07-planning-spec-tests-impl.md, T01-planning-spec-tests-impl.md, PIR-workflow-planning.md, migration-plan-embedded-to-discrete-tasks.md

**Good practice (T07, T01):**
- Consistent 3-section structure (Spec, Test Design, Impl Plan)
- Functional requirements table with IDs and sources
- Test cases table with TC, Name, Behavior
- Implementation phases with step/action/deliverable
- Dependency order diagram
- Out of scope explicitly stated
- Script interfaces (T07), Files to create/modify

**Bad practice / gaps:**
- T01 initially lacked Host Task link (unwired)
- PIR-workflow-planning uses different structure (Executive Summary, Workflow Scope) – more design doc than spec/test/impl
- Migration-plan has TBD placeholders; analysis sections not aligned with spec/test/impl pattern
- No standard template enforced; structure varies

**Proposed canonical structure:** Adopt T07/T01 pattern as baseline; add mandatory Host Task in header; require Verification/Success Criteria section.

### 5. IPW Integration with Implementation Cycle

| Implementation Cycle Step | IPW Relationship |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| Step 2: Task Creation | Host task must exist before IPW |
| Step 3a: Ascertain Specification | Plan doc Spec section captures this |
| Step 3b: Create Tests | Plan doc Test Design guides this |
| Step 4: Implementation | Plan doc Impl Plan guides this |
| Step 5: RW | Unchanged |

IPW produces the plan document that formalizes and persists the output of "ascertain spec" and guides "create tests" and "implementation."

### 6. IPW Deliverables

- **IPW SoP or Workflow Doc** – Step-by-step workflow with checklist
- **Plan Doc Template** – Required structure (Spec, Test Design, Impl Plan, Host Task)
- **Wiring Rules** – Mandatory bidirectional wiring, validation
- **Integration** – Reference from Implementation Cycle SoP, .cursorrules, create-rule/create-skill
- **ICW deprecation / alias package** – See §7

### 7. Consolidation with ICW (Implementation Cycle Workflow)

| Aspect | Before | After (target state) |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| **Canonical planning brand** | ICW + IPW (overlapping) | **IPW only** |
| **User / agent trigger** | `ICW` and informal “plan task X” | **`IPW` / `IPW E:S:T`** (required); `ICW` = deprecated or thin alias |
| **Artifacts** | ICW templates / `docs/implementation-cycles/*` ad hoc + IPW plan doc | **One durable plan doc** per host task, bidirectionally wired (IPW); legacy ICW paths may redirect or merge |
| **Task binding** | FR-048 / `icw_handler` task-id rules | Same **mandatory E:S:T binding** applies to **IPW** sessions |
| **Framework package** | `implementation-cycle-workflow`, `icw_handler.py`, registry **ICW** | Document as **legacy or adapter**; eventually fold useful mechanics into IPW tooling **or** stub with “use IPW” guidance |
| **Release / implementation** | RW + Implementation Cycle | **Unchanged** — IPW does not replace RW or TDD |

**Rationale:** One planning workflow reduces cognitive load and duplicate docs. ICW’s *planning* responsibilities (spec → test design → impl plan, planning-mode agent guidance) are the same scope as IPW; ICW as a **separate** product is redundant.

## Use Cases

1. **Planning for E4:S11:T07:** User requests plan → Agent runs IPW → Creates `T07-planning-spec-tests-impl.md` with spec, tests, impl → Wires to T07 task doc (Input, References) and adds Host Task in plan → Plan discoverable from task and vice versa
2. **Starting implementation:** Developer opens task doc → Sees plan doc in Input/References → Navigates to spec, test design, impl plan → Follows plan for Step 3 and 4
3. **Validating planning completeness:** Automated or manual check ensures no plan doc exists without task doc reference, and wiring is bidirectional
4. **Cursor/Agent trigger:** User types **`IPW`** or **`IPW E:S:T`** → Agent executes IPW workflow (replaces "Plan ExxSxxTxx: Define spec, design tests, plan impl" and supersedes **`ICW`** for that purpose)
5. **Migrating from ICW:** Maintainer renames or aliases **`ICW`** in `.cursorrules` to IPW, updates workflow-registry/README lines for ICW to point at IPW consolidation, and aligns FR-040 / FR-048 text to “planning via IPW” where appropriate

- [x] **FR-042:R04** - Host task doc MUST reference plan doc in Input and References upon plan doc creation
- [x] **FR-042:R05** - Plan doc MUST reference host task doc in header (Host Task link) – **bidirectional wiring is mandatory; both directions required**
- [x] **FR-042:R05a** - Wiring is atomic: plan doc creation and task doc update happen in same IPW session
- [x] **FR-042:R06** - IPW integrated with Implementation Cycle (reference from implementation-cycle-sop, .cursorrules)

- [x] **FR-042:R10** - **`ICW`** is **not** a parallel planning workflow: `.cursorrules` (and adopter equivalents) state **IPW canonical**; **`ICW`** is removed, folded into IPW wording, or documented as **deprecated alias** only (same steps as IPW)
- [x] **FR-042:R11** - Packaged workflow docs (`workflow-registry.yaml`, `implementation-cycle-workflow/README.md` or successor) explain **ICW → IPW** consolidation and point maintainers to IPW
- [x] **FR-042:R12** - **FR-040 / E5:S01:T40** and **FR-048 / E5:S01:T48** cross-reference IPW: task-ID and artifact expectations for planning apply to **IPW**; ICW-specific phrasing updated where it implied a second planning pipeline
- [x] **FR-042:R13** - Optional: **technical follow-up** — repoint or retire `icw_handler.py` / ICW YAML **or** wrap as thin IPW helper (config-driven output dir, no duplicate user-facing workflow brand)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] **FR-042:NF01** - **Traceability:** Plan doc always discoverable from task doc and vice versa

- [x] **AC9:** IPW instruction `IPW` documented as canonical trigger in .cursorrules or create-rule skill
- [x] **AC10:** `.cursorrules` (ICW section) updated: **IPW** canonical for planning; **ICW** deprecated or alias-only, consistent with §7
- [x] **AC11:** Framework workflow registry / ICW package README state consolidation; no contradictory “use ICW for planning” without IPW equivalence
- [x] **AC12:** **FR-040** header or notes reference IPW as successor scope for **planning** (implementation delivery history of T40 may remain historical)
