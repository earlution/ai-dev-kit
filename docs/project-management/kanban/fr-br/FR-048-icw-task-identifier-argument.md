# Feature Request: ICW Task Identifier Argument

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2026-03-10  
**Submitted By:** RMS (AI Dev Kit)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** PENDING  
**GitHub Issue:** TBD

---

## Summary

Extend the Implementation Cycle Workflow (ICW) to require a task identifier argument when called, ensuring the workflow is explicitly bound to a specific Kanban task with clear Epic/Story/Task numbering.

---

## Description

### What functionality is desired?

The ICW should require a task identifier argument when invoked, with the following requirements:

1. **Mandatory Task ID:** ICW calls must include a task identifier argument
2. **Clear E/S/T Numbering:** The identifier must clearly reference Epic/Story/Task numbers
3. **Flexible Formatting:** The exact format can be flexible as long as the task is unambiguous
4. **Planning Mode Enforcement:** The task identifier requirement works in conjunction with the existing planning mode requirement

### What problem does this solve?

Currently, the ICW can be called without explicit task binding, which can lead to:

- **Ambiguous Workflows:** ICW runs without clear association to specific Kanban tasks
- **Lost Traceability:** Difficulty linking ICW execution back to specific requirements
- **Poor Planning Integration:** Weak connection between ICW sessions and Kanban planning

### What is the use case?

- **Task-Specific Planning:** Users want to run ICW for specific tasks like "E5:S01:T47"
- **Clear Workflow Context:** Ensure ICW sessions are explicitly tied to Kanban requirements
- **Improved Traceability:** Direct mapping between ICW execution and task documentation
- **Better Planning Integration:** Strengthen the connection between ICW and Kanban planning

### Who would benefit from this feature?

- **ICW Users:** Clear task context for their implementation planning sessions
- **Project Managers:** Better visibility into which tasks are being worked on
- **Developers:** Explicit task binding for their implementation work
- **Auditors:** Clear traceability between ICW sessions and Kanban tasks

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] **FR-048:R01** – ICW requires a task identifier argument when invoked
- [ ] **FR-048:R02** – Task identifier must include clear E/S/T numbering (e.g., "E5:S01:T47")
- [ ] **FR-048:R03** – Flexible formatting support for various task identifier formats
- [ ] **FR-048:R04** – Validation that the task identifier references an existing Kanban task
- [ ] **FR-048:R05** – Integration with existing planning mode requirement
- [ ] **FR-048:R06** – Clear error messages when task identifier is missing or invalid

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] **FR-048:NF01** – **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure existing ICW functionality remains intact
- [ ] **FR-048:NF02** – **User Experience:** Clear and helpful error messages
- [ ] **FR-048:NF03** – **Performance:** Minimal impact on ICW startup time

## Scope Analysis

**Problem Domain:** Implementation Cycle Workflow (ICW), Task Management, Planning Integration  
**Affected Areas:**

- [x] Documentation
- [x] Testing
- [x] ICW Handler Scripts
- [x] Configuration
- [ ] Backend/API
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [ ] Other: Kanban integration

**Estimated Complexity:**

- [x] Simple (1-3 days)
- [ ] Medium (1 week)
- [ ] Complex (2+ weeks)
- [ ] Very Complex (1+ month)

---

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case

1. User wants to run ICW for a specific task
2. User calls ICW with task identifier: `icw --task E5:S01:T47`
3. ICW validates the task exists in Kanban
4. ICW proceeds with planning mode execution for that specific task
5. All ICW output and artifacts are linked to the task identifier

### Additional Use Cases

- **Multiple Formats:** Support various formats like "E5:S01:T47", "E5S01T47", "T47"
- **Task Validation:** Verify task exists before proceeding
- **Error Handling:** Clear guidance when task identifier is invalid
- **Documentation Integration:** Automatic linking to task documentation

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** ICW requires task identifier argument and fails gracefully without it
- [ ] **AC2:** Task identifier validation checks for E/S/T numbering patterns
- [ ] **AC-3:** ICW validates that referenced task exists in Kanban
- [ ] **AC4:** Clear error messages guide users to correct task identifier format
- [ ] **AC5:** ICW execution context is explicitly bound to the specified task
- [ ] **AC6:** Planning mode requirement remains intact with task identifier requirement

---

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**

- ICW task-specific planning sessions
- Improved ICW-Kanban integration

**Blocked By:**

- None (this is an enhancement to existing ICW functionality)

**Related Work:**

- E5:S01:T40 – Implementation Cycle Workflow (ICW)
- FR-040 – Implementation Cycle Workflow (ICW)
- ICW Handler Scripts and Configuration
