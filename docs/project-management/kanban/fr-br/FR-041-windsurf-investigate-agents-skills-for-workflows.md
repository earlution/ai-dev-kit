# FR-041: Windsurf: Investigate how to leverage AGENTS.md and SKILL.md for workflows

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Created:** 2026-03-11  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-11 (v0.6.6.3+2 - FR created)  
**Started:** [TBD]  
**Completed:** [TBD]  
**Version:** v0.6.6.3+2  
**Code:** FR-041

## Problem Statement

**Current Issues with Workflow Execution:**
- Cascade doesn't understand specialized workflows (RW, UKW, etc.)
- Agent behavior is inconsistent across workflow types
- No clear agent specialization for different task types
- Manual intervention required for complex multi-step workflows
- Terminal interaction problems with agent execution
- Lack of agent capability definitions for specific workflow steps

**Root Cause:**
- No AGENTS.md to define specialized workflow agents
- No SKILL.md to define agent capabilities
- Cascade uses generic agent behavior instead of workflow-specific intelligence
- Missing agent configuration for ai-dev-kit's complex workflow patterns

---

## Solution Overview

**Investigate and implement AGENTS.md and SKILL.md to:**
1. Define specialized agents for each workflow type (RW, UKW, MW, etc.)
2. Define skills/capabilities for each workflow step
3. Enable Cascade to understand and execute workflows autonomously
4. Improve agent specialization and task distribution
5. Reduce manual intervention in complex workflows

---

## Investigation Scope

### Phase 1: Research and Analysis
- **Research Windsurf AGENTS.md specification and capabilities**
- **Research SKILL.md format and skill definition patterns**
- **Analyze current ai-dev-kit workflows for agent specialization opportunities**
- **Identify workflow steps that can benefit from agent specialization**
- **Document current pain points and agent behavior issues**

### Phase 2: Agent Architecture Design
- **Design agent definitions for each workflow type:**
  - RW Agent (Release Workflow specialist)
  - UKW Agent (Universal Kanban Workflow specialist)  
  - MW Agent (Migration Workflow specialist)
  - FR/BR Agent (Feature Request/Bug Report processing specialist)
  - Validation Agent (Branch safety, changelog format validation)
  - Documentation Agent (README, changelog, kanban docs updates)


- **Design skill definitions for workflow capabilities:**
  - Version bumping skills
  - Changelog generation skills
  - Git operation skills (with proper terminal interaction)
  - Kanban board update skills
  - Validation and verification skills
  - Documentation update skills


### Phase 3: Implementation and Testing
- **Create AGENTS.md with specialized agent definitions**
- **Create .windsurf/skills/SKILL.md with capability definitions**
- **Test agent behavior with RW -d workflow execution**
- **Test agent behavior with UKW workflow execution**
- **Validate improved terminal interaction and command execution**
- **Measure reduction in manual intervention requirements**

### Phase 4: Integration and Documentation
- **Integrate agent definitions with existing workflow infrastructure**
- **Update workflow documentation to reference agent capabilities**
- **Create agent configuration guides for workflow maintainers**
- **Document best practices for agent specialization**

## Expected Outcomes

### Primary Benefits
- **Autonomous Workflow Execution:** Cascade understands and executes workflows without manual guidance
- **Agent Specialization:** Each workflow step handled by appropriately skilled agent
- **Improved Terminal Interaction:** Agents properly execute git commands and validation scripts
- **Reduced Manual Intervention:** Complex workflows run end-to-end without user assistance
- **Consistent Agent Behavior:** Predictable agent performance across workflow types

### Secondary Benefits
- **Better Error Handling:** Specialized agents provide more targeted error messages
- **Workflow Scalability:** Ability to run multiple concurrent workflows with different agents
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns between agent types and skills
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new workflow types and agent capabilities
