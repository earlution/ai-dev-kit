# Feature Request: Agentic Kanban Task Creation from FR/BR

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-10  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Severity:** N/A  
**Status:** PENDING  

---

## Summary

Need a workflow that automatically creates Kanban tasks (from template) from FRs and BRs. It's going to need to be agentic, as intelligence will be required.

---

## Description

### What is the Feature?

An intelligent, agentic workflow that automatically creates Kanban tasks from Feature Requests (FRs) and Bug Reports (BRs) using templates. The workflow must be intelligent enough to:

- Analyze FR/BR content to understand requirements
- Determine appropriate Epic, Story, and Task structure
- Create tasks from templates with proper contextualization
- Map FR/BR content to appropriate canonical epics/stories
- Generate task descriptions, acceptance criteria, and dependencies
- Handle edge cases and ambiguous requirements intelligently

### What Should Happen vs. What Currently Happens?

**Expected Behavior:**
- User submits FR or BR (via GitHub or other intake mechanism)
- Agentic workflow analyzes the FR/BR content
- Workflow intelligently determines:
  - Which Epic(s) the FR/BR belongs to
  - Which Story(ies) within those Epics
  - How many tasks are needed
  - What each task should contain

- Workflow creates Kanban tasks from templates
- Tasks are properly contextualized with FR/BR information
- Tasks are linked back to the original FR/BR
- User/agent can review and adjust as needed

**Current Behavior:**
- FR/BR intake exists (Epic 4 Story 2)
- Manual task creation required
- No automatic task generation from FR/BR content
- No intelligent mapping to canonical epics/stories

### When Does It Occur?

This feature is needed whenever:
- A new FR is submitted
- A new BR is submitted
- An existing FR/BR needs to be converted to tasks
- Bulk FR/BR processing is required

### Who is Affected?

**Primary Affected:**
- Developers/agents creating tasks from FRs/BRs
- Project managers organizing work
- Teams adopting the Kanban framework

**Secondary Affected:**
- Framework maintainers (workflow implementation)
- Framework users (workflow usage)

---

## Use Cases

1. **Automatic Task Creation from GitHub Issues:**
   - User submits FR via GitHub issue form
   - Workflow automatically creates Kanban tasks
   - Tasks are properly structured and linked

2. **Intelligent Epic/Story Mapping:**
   - FR describes a new feature requiring multiple epics
   - Workflow intelligently determines which epics/stories are needed
   - Creates tasks across multiple epics/stories as appropriate

3. **Template-Based Task Generation:**
   - FR/BR content is analyzed
   - Appropriate task templates are selected
   - Tasks are created with proper contextualization

4. **Bulk Processing:**
   - Multiple FRs/BRs submitted at once
   - Workflow processes all of them intelligently
   - Creates tasks efficiently

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **FR/BR Analysis:**
   - Parse FR/BR content (title, description, acceptance criteria, etc.)
   - Extract key information (requirements, scope, dependencies)
   - Identify technical and non-technical requirements

2. **Intelligent Mapping:**
   - Map FR/BR to appropriate canonical epics using semantic matching
   - Determine which stories within epics are relevant
   - Identify if new stories need to be created

3. **Task Template Selection:**
   - Select appropriate task templates based on FR/BR content
   - Choose templates that match the work type (implementation, testing, documentation, etc.)

4. **Task Creation:**
   - Create tasks from templates
   - Contextualize templates with FR/BR information
   - Set proper task metadata (priority, dependencies, acceptance criteria)
   - Link tasks back to original FR/BR

5. **Agentic Intelligence:**
   - Understand context and requirements
   - Make intelligent decisions about task structure
   - Handle ambiguous or incomplete information
   - Provide explanations for decisions made

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Intelligence:**
   - Must be agentic (AI/LLM-powered)
   - Must understand context and make reasoned decisions
   - Must provide explanations for decisions

2. **Integration:**
   - Must integrate with existing FR/BR intake workflow (Epic 4 Story 2)
   - Must integrate with Kanban framework
   - Must integrate with GitHub (if applicable)

3. **Extensibility:**
   - Must be extensible for different FR/BR sources
   - Must support custom task templates
   - Must allow for workflow customization

---

## Problems Solved

1. **Manual Task Creation Overhead:** Eliminates manual work of creating tasks from FRs/BRs
2. **Inconsistent Task Structure:** Ensures consistent task structure using templates
3. **Epic/Story Mapping Errors:** Reduces errors in mapping FRs/BRs to appropriate epics/stories
4. **Context Loss:** Preserves FR/BR context in created tasks
5. **Scalability:** Enables efficient processing of large numbers of FRs/BRs

---

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- Efficient FR/BR to task conversion workflow
- Intelligent epic/story mapping
- Template-based task generation

**Blocked By:**
- Epic 4 Story 2: FR/BR Intake to Tasks (intake foundation)
- Epic 4 Story 6: Comprehensive Canonical E/S/T Template System (template foundation)
- Epic 4 Story 8: Intelligent Epic Matching and Canonical Structure Adoption (semantic matching foundation)

**Coordinates With:**
- Epic 2: Workflow Management Framework (workflow execution)
- Epic 4: Kanban Framework (Kanban integration)
- Epic 4 Story 8: Intelligent Epic Matching (semantic matching)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Workflow can analyze FR/BR content intelligently
2. ✅ Workflow can map FR/BR to appropriate canonical epics/stories
3. ✅ Workflow can create tasks from templates with proper contextualization
4. ✅ Workflow provides explanations for decisions made
5. ✅ Workflow integrates with existing FR/BR intake process
6. ✅ Workflow handles edge cases and ambiguous requirements
7. ✅ Workflow can process multiple FRs/BRs efficiently

## Notes

This feature requires agentic intelligence (AI/LLM) to:
- Understand FR/BR content and requirements
- Make intelligent decisions about task structure
- Handle ambiguous or incomplete information
- Provide explanations for decisions

The workflow should leverage:
- Existing semantic matching capabilities (Epic 4 Story 8)
- Existing template system (Epic 4 Story 6)
- Agentic intelligence foundation (Epic 4 Story 9)
