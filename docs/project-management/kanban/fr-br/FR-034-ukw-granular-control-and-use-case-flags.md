# Feature Request: UKW Granular Control and Use Case Flags

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2026-01-16  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** PENDING  
**GitHub Issue:** [TBD]  
**Version:** [TBD]

---

## Summary

Add granular control to UKW (Update Kanban Workflow) via use case flags and flexible task targeting syntax, enabling users to run only the operations they need (bookkeeping, priority updates, priority assignment) rather than executing the full monolithic workflow every time.

**Note (SoP Compliance):** This FR was extracted from a mixed-scope document (BR-033) following the Standard Operating Procedure for handling mixed BR/FR scope. The bug content (epic ordering disorganization) remains in BR-033. Priority assignment and granular control enhancements are documented here. See "Related Work" section for link to BR-033.

## Description

### What is the Feature?

A modular UKW workflow system that supports:
- **Use case flags** (`-u`, `-p`, `-a`) to run specific operations independently
- **Flexible task targeting syntax** for priority assignment operations
- **Efficient defaults** (bookkeeping only by default, priority operations opt-in)
- **Combined operations** when needed

### What Should Happen vs. What Currently Happens?

**Expected Behavior:**
- `UKW` (no flags) runs bookkeeping only (lightweight, frequent)
- `UKW -u` runs bookkeeping (sorting and organization)
- `UKW -p` updates priorities of existing tasks (expensive, occasional)
- `UKW -a E09S01T01` assigns priority to specific task (targeted, efficient)
- `UKW -a E09` assigns priorities to entire epic
- `UKW -u -p -a all` runs full UKW when needed
- Users can run only the operations they need, reducing unnecessary AI processing

**Current Behavior:**
- UKW runs as a monolithic workflow
- All steps execute regardless of need
- Priority operations (expensive AI processing) run even when only bookkeeping is needed
- No way to target specific tasks/epics/stories for priority operations
- Inefficient for frequent bookkeeping operations

### What Problem Does This Solve?

**Efficiency Problem:**
- Priority operations require significant agentic intelligence (context analysis, dependency evaluation, strategic alignment, impact assessment)
- Running expensive operations on every UKW execution is wasteful when only bookkeeping is needed
- Users want to run bookkeeping frequently (lightweight) but priority operations only when needed (expensive)

**Usability Problem:**
- No way to run only specific operations
- No way to target specific tasks/epics/stories for priority assignment
- Must run full workflow even for simple operations

### Who Would Benefit from This Feature?

- **Project Managers:** Can run bookkeeping frequently without overhead
- **Developers:** Can target specific tasks for priority assignment
- **AI Agents:** Reduced processing time for frequent operations
- **All Users:** More efficient workflow execution

- Before important planning sessions (frequent)

**Benefits:**
- Fast execution (lightweight)
- No expensive AI processing
- Can run frequently without overhead

### UC2: Update Priorities
**Description:** Update priorities of existing tasks without sorting.

**Command:** `UKW -p`

**When to Use:**
- After project goals change (occasional)
- When dependencies shift (occasional)
- When deadlines change (occasional)
- After strategic planning sessions (occasional)

**Benefits:**
- Focused operation (no sorting overhead)
- Intelligent priority reassessment
- Run only when needed

### UC3: Assign Priorities
**Description:** Assign priorities to specified/all tasks without priority.

**Command Examples:**
- `UKW -a E09S01T01` (single task)
- `UKW -a E09S01T01,E08S02T11` (multiple tasks)
- `UKW -a E09S01T01-E09S01T06` (linear range)
- `UKW -a E09S01` (entire story)
- `UKW -a E09` (entire epic)
- `UKW -a all` (all unprioritized)

**When to Use:**
- After creating new tasks (occasional, targeted)
- When tasks are missing priorities (occasional, targeted)
- When bulk priority assignment is needed (rare, full analysis)

**Benefits:**
- Targeted execution (focus on specific tasks)
- Flexible syntax (user convenience)
- Efficient processing (only analyze what's needed)

### UC4: Combined Operations
**Description:** Run multiple operations in a single UKW execution.

**Command Examples:**
- `UKW -u -p` (bookkeeping + update priorities)

- `UKW -u -p -a all` (full UKW - all operations)

**When to Use:**
- When multiple operations are needed
- After major project changes
- Comprehensive kanban synchronization

**Benefits:**
- Single command for multiple operations
- Efficient execution (no redundant processing)
- Flexible combination of operations

## Notes

**SoP Compliance:**
This FR was extracted from a mixed-scope document (BR-033) following the Standard Operating Procedure for handling mixed BR/FR scope. The bug content (epic ordering disorganization) remains in BR-033. All priority-related functionality (assignment, updates, granular control) is documented here to maintain clear separation of concerns.

**Efficiency Rationale:**
Priority operations (UC2/UC3) require significant agentic intelligence and are computationally expensive. Running them on every UKW execution is wasteful when only bookkeeping is needed. This feature enables users to run only the operations they need, reducing unnecessary AI processing and improving response times.

**Syntax Philosophy:**
- **Flexibility:** Support multiple input formats for user convenience
- **Normalization:** Convert to canonical format internally
- **Validation:** Strict validation with clear error messages
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent output format regardless of input format

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Phase 1:** Extract sorting logic into modular function
2. **Phase 2:** Extract priority operations into modular functions
3. **Phase 3:** Implement syntax parser for flexible task targeting
4. **Phase 4:** Add command-line argument parsing
5. **Phase 5:** Integrate with workflow YAML
6. **Phase 6:** Update documentation
