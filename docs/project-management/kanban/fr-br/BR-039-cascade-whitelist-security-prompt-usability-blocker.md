## Problem Statement

Cascade's whitelist feature is non-functional, creating constant security prompt interruptions that prevent productive workflow execution. Users must manually approve every single command despite previous approvals, making the tool unusable for continuous development work.

## Video Evidence

**Reference:** `Screen Recording 2026-03-09 at 16.07.14.mov` (project root)

## Detailed Description

### Expected Behavior
- **Whitelist Persistence:** Once a command is whitelisted, it should not prompt again
- **AI Enable:** When AI is enabled, security prompts should be minimized for trusted commands
- **Continuous Workflow:** Users should be able to work without constant interruption

### Actual Behavior
- **Whitelist Ignored:** Security prompts appear for every command regardless of whitelist status
- **AI Enable Ineffective:** Even with AI enabled, every script/terminal command requires manual approval
- **Constant Interruption:** Users cannot complete more than 1-2 commands without being stopped
- **Productivity Killer:** Focus shifts from project work to tool management

### Specific Issues Identified

1. **Whitelist Memory Loss:** Commands added to whitelist are forgotten between sessions
2. **Prompt Fatigue:** Same commands trigger security prompts repeatedly
3. **Work Flow Disruption:** Cannot maintain focus on development tasks
4. **Tool Adoption Barrier:** Makes Windsurf unusable for real development work

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience Impact
- **CRITICAL:** Tool becomes unusable for continuous development
- **Productivity Loss:** 80%+ of time spent on tool management vs. actual work
- **Frustration Level:** Extreme - users abandon tool despite potential benefits

### Development Workflow Impact
- **Release Workflow:** Cannot execute automated workflows without constant approval
- **Testing:** Cannot run test suites without manual intervention for each test
- **Build Processes:** Cannot maintain build workflows due to prompt interruptions

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Issues
- **State Management:** Whitelist state not properly persisted
- **Security Model:** Overly aggressive security prompts override user preferences
- **Configuration:** AI enable and whitelist settings not properly integrated

### Design Issues
- **User Trust:** Security model assumes zero trust even for user-approved actions
- **Workflow Integration:** Security prompts not designed for continuous development workflows
- **Feedback Loop:** No mechanism for users to report or work around whitelist failures

## Reproduction Steps

1. **Enable AI** in Cascade settings
2. **Run any command** (e.g., `python script.py`)
3. **Approve the command** when security prompt appears
4. **Add command to whitelist** if option available
5. **Run the same command again**
6. **Observe:** Security prompt appears again despite whitelist

## Expected Resolution

### Immediate Fixes
- **Whitelist Persistence:** Ensure whitelisted commands remain whitelisted across sessions
- **AI Enable Integration:** Respect AI enable setting for reducing prompts
- **Session Memory:** Maintain whitelist state within current session

### Long-term Improvements
- **Trust Learning:** System should learn user patterns and reduce prompts over time
- **Workflow Mode:** Special mode for development workflows with minimal security prompts
- **User Control:** Granular control over security prompt frequency and scope

## Workarounds

### For this project (ai-dev-kit maintainer)

- **Standard IDE:** **Cursor** for all repo work, including **RW** and validator-driven workflows. **Windsurf is not used** (no subscription); there is **no** ongoing Cascade-in-Windsurf verification from this maintainer.
- **BR-039** remains the **product** record for Cascade behavior if others (vendor, subscribers) re-test.

### Original report context (historical)

- **Manual Approval:** Continue manually approving every command (not sustainable for Cascade users)
- **Tool Switching:** Use **Cursor** (or another IDE) when Cascade prompts block automation
- **Limited Usage:** Use affected IDE only for non-automated tasks (reduces value)

### Other mitigations (general)

- **Batch Commands:** Combine multiple operations into single commands (limited effectiveness)
- **External Scripts:** Run automation outside the affected agent UI where possible

## Re-verification Protocol

When vendor releases relevant changes, run this protocol before any closure claim:

1. Capture vendor version/build under test.
2. Re-run the BR-039 reproduction steps.
3. Execute a terminal-heavy continuity sequence (RW-like command flow).
4. Record results in evidence log format.
5. Classify outcome as `pass`, `fail`, or `blocked`.
6. Update T57 + BR status text using attempted/verified language only.

## Evidence Log Format

Use append-only entries with these fields:

- `date_utc`
- `tool_version`
- `scenario`
- `expected`
- `observed`
- `result` (`pass` | `fail` | `blocked`)
- `notes` (workaround, escalation, owner)

### Log entry E1 — 2026-04-02

- **date_utc:** 2026-04-02 14:44 UTC  
- **tool_version:** Windsurf **1.9577.27** (`/Applications/Windsurf.app` plist); executor shell Cursor **2.6.20** (validators only).  
- **scenario:** (1) BR-039 interactive repro — not run (UI). (2) `validate_branch_context.py --strict`; `validate_rw_task_complete.py --requested E6:S06:T57` on `epic/6-framework-management`.  
- **expected:** (1) Whitelist persists, no repeat prompt. (2) Validator exit 0.  
- **observed:** (1) Not executed here. (2) Exit 0 for both.  
- **result:** **`blocked`** for (1); auxiliary **`pass`** for (2) — does not prove Cascade fixed.  
- **notes:** Mirror of [T57 — Evidence § E1](../epics/Epic-6/Story-006-feature-requests/T57-br039-cascade-whitelist-security-prompt-blocker.md). *(Superseded for this maintainer by **E2**: optional Windsurf retest **waived** — Cursor-only.)*

### Log entry E2 — 2026-04-02 (reporter Cursor-only)

- **date_utc:** 2026-04-02 (maintainer follow-up)  
- **tool_version:** Primary: **Cursor**. Windsurf retest **waived** (reference build **1.9577.27** from **E1** only).  
- **scenario:** Optional BR-039 repro in Windsurf — **declined** by implementing maintainer.  
- **expected:** N/A (waived).  
- **observed:** Maintainer **switched back to Cursor**; no Windsurf verification planned.  
- **result:** **`blocked` / waived (reporter)** — product behavior **not** re-tested; **not** “fixed”.  
- **notes:** Mirror of [T57 — Evidence § E2](../epics/Epic-6/Story-006-feature-requests/T57-br039-cascade-whitelist-security-prompt-blocker.md). **Superseded** by maintainer policy: **no Windsurf subscription** — **T57** closed repo-side; **BR-039** remains for **Cascade** product state.

## Success Criteria

### Resolution Criteria
- [ ] Whitelisted commands do not prompt again
- [ ] AI enable setting reduces security prompts appropriately
- [ ] Users can execute workflows without constant interruption
- [ ] Security model balances safety with usability

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] User can complete 10+ commands without security prompts for whitelisted items
- [ ] Release workflows execute continuously without manual approval
- [ ] Development focus remains on project work, not tool management

**Language guardrail:** Until validation criteria are met on current vendor build, document updates as **attempted fix** or **change implemented**, not **fixed/resolved/completed**.

## Related Issues

- **BR-038:** Release Workflow Micromanagement and Tool Discovery Issues (symptom of this root cause)
- **E6:S06:T02:** Fix Release Workflow Micromanagement Issues (attempted to fix symptoms, not root cause)
- **E6:S06:T57:** Implementing task — [T57](../epics/Epic-6/Story-006-feature-requests/T57-br039-cascade-whitelist-security-prompt-blocker.md)

## Priority Justification

**CRITICAL** priority because:
- **Blocks Development:** Prevents any meaningful use of Windsurf for development
- **User Abandonment:** High risk of users abandoning the tool despite potential benefits
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Cursor does not have this issue, creating competitive pressure
- **Product Viability:** Core functionality is unusable for target use case

## Resolution Timeline

**Target Resolution:** ASAP - This is a blocking issue for tool adoption

**Next Steps:**
1. Document this bug report thoroughly *(done)*
2. Escalate to Cascade development team / community
3. Provide reproduction steps and video evidence *(historical assets in repo)*
4. Track resolution via **BR-039** evidence log — **third-party or vendor** re-verification

**Maintainer (this repo) until BR closed elsewhere:**
- **Cursor-only** workflow; **no** Windsurf verification
- **T57** **COMPLETE** = repo obligations met; does **not** close **BR-039**
