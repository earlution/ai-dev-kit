## Tasks

### E7:S01:T01 – PERPETUAL: Address IDE-Flagged Error, Warning, and Info level problems

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E7:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone)

**Type:** PERPETUAL (ongoing maintenance task)  
**Input:** IDE-flagged issues (errors, warnings, info) from development environment  
**Deliverable:** Continuous resolution of IDE-flagged issues, maintaining codebase health  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Blocker:** None  
**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe (can develop independently)

**Status:** PERPETUAL (ongoing)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last Maintenance Cycle:** [Track each maintenance cycle with version markers]

**Approach:**

1. **Monitor IDE Flags:** Regularly review IDE-flagged issues across the codebase
   - Errors (highest priority - must be addressed)
   - Warnings (high priority - should be addressed)
   - Info (medium priority - address when convenient)

2. **Prioritize Issues:**
   - Address errors first (blocking issues)
   - Address warnings next (quality issues)
   - Address info-level issues as time permits (nice-to-have improvements)

3. **Batch Work:**
   - Group related issues for efficient resolution
   - Create version markers for each batch of work completed
   - Track progress in this task's maintenance history

4. **Document Resolution:**
   - Document fixes in changelog when appropriate
   - Update this task with version markers for each maintenance cycle
   - Note any patterns or systemic issues discovered

5. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Set up regular reviews (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly)
   - Integrate with development workflow
   - Prevent accumulation of technical debt

**Maintenance History:**

- Track each maintenance cycle with version markers
- Example: `v0.7.1.1+1 - Addressed 15 IDE errors, 8 warnings in packages/frameworks`
- Example: `v0.7.1.1+2 - Resolved linting issues in validation scripts`

**Success Criteria:**

- IDE-flagged errors are addressed promptly (within 1-2 development cycles)
- IDE-flagged warnings are addressed regularly (within 2-4 development cycles)
- Info-level issues are addressed as time permits
- Codebase health metrics show improvement over time
- No accumulation of critical errors

**Files to Monitor:**

- All source files in the project
- Focus on active development areas
- Prioritize framework packages and core functionality

**Integration Points:**

- **Epic 4 (Kanban Framework):** Track maintenance work through Kanban tasks
- **Epic 6 (BR Implementation):** Convert complex IDE issues to Bug Reports when appropriate
- **Epic 2 (Workflow Management):** May use workflows for automated issue detection

**Notes:**

- This is a PERPETUAL task - it never truly "completes" but is continuously worked on
- Track progress with version markers for each maintenance cycle
- Focus on maintaining codebase health rather than achieving "zero issues"
- Some info-level issues may be acceptable if they don't impact functionality

- Documentation updated with integration details
- Examples demonstrate Kanban usage for maintenance

---

### E7:S01:T06 – Implement Update Changelog Workflow (UCW)

**Input:** FR-057 Update Changelog Workflow, FR-025/FR-026 archival policies, RW validator contract  
**Deliverable:** UCW workflow (docs + scripts) that trims `CHANGELOG.md`, archives older entries, and integrates with Release Workflow validation  
**Dependencies:** FR-057, FR-025, FR-026  
**Blocker:** None  
**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Version Marker:** v0.7.1.5+6 (RW-k filing)

**Approach:**

1. Author UCW workflow assets (README, YAML, config) under workflow management package.  
2. Implement UCW runner (`update_changelog_docs.py`) enforcing retention + archival policy.  
3. Integrate UCW invocation into RW (post-step 3) and document SOP in release runbook and CHANGELOG policy section.  
4. Add regression tests covering retention thresholds, ordering, archive integrity, duplicate detection, and dry-run previews.  
5. Execute UCW to trim `CHANGELOG.md`, generate archive entries, and verify validators pass.  
6. Wire UCW outputs back into Kanban docs (epic/story/board) and perpetual changelog maintenance logs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Latest-only main changelog enforced (configurable retention, default 20 entries).  
- Archived entries gain backlinks and RW validator passes immediately after UCW run.  
- CLI supports `--retention`, `--dry-run`, `--auto` flags with clear reporting.  
- Documentation clearly distinguishes UCW vs UKW responsibilities and provides SOP.  
- Tests cover retention boundaries, ordering, duplicates, archive write failures, and dry-run safety.  
- Task tracked via `T06-update-changelog-workflow.md` with evidence of UCW execution logs.

### E7:S01:T07 – Markdown Maintenance Workflow (MMW)

**Input:** FR-058 Markdown Maintenance Workflow, E7:S01:T05 perpetual markdown task, documentation validator outputs  
**Deliverable:** Deterministic workflow + tooling that triages RW markdown validation failures, distinguishes regressions vs legacy debt, and drives remediation cycles with auditable evidence  
**Dependencies:** FR-058, Documentation Policy Framework, Release Runbook RW Step 8  
**Blocker:** None  
**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Version Marker:** v0.7.1.6+2 (FR filing)

**Approach:**

1. Author ICW artifacts (spec/test/plan) describing MMW phases, roles, CI hook contract, and evidence requirements.  
2. Extend documentation validator to emit scoped vs baseline findings; integrate with RW + MMW decision tree.  
3. Build checklist + log template under `docs/maintenance/logs/mmw/` and wire to RW Step 8 fallback path.  
4. Execute initial MMW maintenance cycle targeting representative backlog slice; capture diff + log.  
5. Update Release Runbook, Kanban board, and Story references to include MMW instructions and status reporting.  
6. Coordinate with T05 to ensure perpetual markdown maintenance metrics get updated per cycle.  
7. Create a dedicated **MMW Perpetual Task** (E7:S01:T08 placeholder) that RW teams can update/run against whenever markdown debt blocks a release, ensuring each RW has an up-to-date maintenance checkpoint.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Validator supports scoped/baseline modes with documented CLI usage.  
- RW runbook defines MMW trigger + evidence requirements; CI hook blocks releases lacking MMW log when baseline debt remains.  
- `docs/maintenance/logs/mmw/` contains checklist/log entries for first maintenance cycle with before/after stats.  
- Kanban Story + task docs reference FR-058 and include completion markers once workflow is operational.  
- Perpetual markdown maintenance Task (T05) includes pointers to MMW cycle outputs as ongoing maintenance mechanism.

### E7:S01:T08 – Task Doc Naming Standardization

**Input:** User directive (2026-03-16) to adopt `EddSddTdd-[Task Title].md` naming, Documentation Policy Framework, Kanban board structure  
**Deliverable:** Canonical naming standard applied to all task docs plus migration tooling/checklist to keep Release Workflow and Kanban references consistent  
**Dependencies:** Documentation Policy Framework updates, Release Runbook references, Story/Epic file cross-links  
**Blocker:** None  
**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Version Marker:** v0.7.1.6+3

**Approach:**

1. Update Documentation Policy + Kanban board guide to codify the `EddSddTdd-[title].md` format (with 3-digit Task exception).  
2. Inventory all existing task files; generate mapping old→new names with traceability log.  
3. Build/execute rename plan (script or documented steps) ensuring links in Story/Epic/FR/kanban board update atomically.  
4. Add validator or lint rule to flag future deviations.  
5. Provide RW guidance describing how task renames impact step 4 updates + evidence storage.  
6. Publish migration completion log under `docs/maintenance/logs/mmw/` or similar for audit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Documentation policy + runbook explicitly reference the new naming scheme and exceptions.  
- All task files under `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/**` follow the new naming format (or are queued with migration checklist).  
- Kanban board/task references resolve correctly after renames; validator confirms no broken links.  
- A lint/validation hook exists to prevent regressions.  
- Migration summary captured (versions, files renamed, blockers) for future audits.
