# E7:S06:T15 – Intake Workflow Windsurf Impact Review

**Task:** E7:S06:T15
**Workflow:** Intake (FR/BR/UXR processing)
**Review Date:** 2026-03-18
**Status:** Complete

## Windsurf Impact

### Extent of Windsurf-Specific Logic

`intake-process` and `fr_br_uxr_completed_update` encode intake behavior. intake-process states "This workflow requires significant agentic intelligence" – aligned. fr_br_uxr_completed_update is document-update interface (kanban_completed pattern for FR/BR/UXR).

### Divergence from .cursorrules

Intake workflow in .cursorrules requires agentic analysis. intake-process matches: "Analyze comprehensively," "Prioritize strategically," "Create tasks." fr_br_uxr_completed_update is procedural but scoped to doc updates.

### Risk to Cursor-Native Execution

**Low risk.** intake-process reinforces agentic model. fr_br_uxr_completed_update procedural steps are doc-interface focused.

## Skill Mappings

| .windsurf Skill | Purpose | .cursorrules Equivalent | Target Path |
|-----------------|---------|--------------------------|-------------|
| intake-process | FR/BR/UXR intake; task creation | Intake workflow; agentic analysis | .cursor/skills/intake-process |
| fr_br_uxr_completed_update | Update fr-br-uxr-completed.md | UKW FR/BR/UXR sync; doc interface | .cursor/skills/fr-br-uxr-completed-update |

---

## Migration Plan

1. Copy `intake-process` to .cursor/skills/intake-process – retain intelligence requirements.
2. Copy `fr_br_uxr_completed_update` to .cursor/skills/fr-br-uxr-completed-update.
3. Remove .windsurf/skills/intake-process, fr_br_uxr_completed_update.

---

## Anti-Pattern Findings

**Finding:** intake-process aligns with agentic model. fr_br_uxr_completed_update has procedural interface – acceptable for doc updates. **None observed** for determinism in intake-process; minor procedural bias in fr_br_uxr_completed_update.
