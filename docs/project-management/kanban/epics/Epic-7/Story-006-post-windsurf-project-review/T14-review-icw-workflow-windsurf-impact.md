# E7:S06:T14 – Review ICW Workflow (Windsurf Impact)

**Task ID:** E7:S06:T14
**Status:** TODO
**Priority:** HIGH
**Last updated:** 2026-03-18
**Blocks:** E7:S06:T01 (Windsurf artifact cleanup)

---

## Scope

Review Implementation Cycle Workflow (ICW) for Windsurf impact, .windsurf skill mappings, and migration needs. Deliverable informs T01 cleanup/migration.

## Anti-Pattern Vigilance

**Be vigilant for:** Windsurf models deferring to deterministic, script-everything approaches when this workflow requires agentic intelligence.

- **Anti-pattern:** Over-reliance on rigid scripts, hardcoded paths, or "run X then Y" sequences without reasoning, synthesis, or adaptive fallbacks.
- **Expected:** Agent-driven execution: analyze context, make intelligent decisions, handle failures with workarounds, synthesize narrative updates where required.
- **Review for:** .windsurf skills or docs that would steer implementers toward script-orchestration rather than agentic reasoning for this workflow.

## Input

- .cursorrules ICW section
- .windsurf/skills/ (if any ICW-specific)
- packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/implementation-cycle-workflow/

## Deliverable

Review document: Windsurf impact assessment; .windsurf dependencies; migration plan for .cursor/skills/ or .cursorrules

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Windsurf impact on ICW documented
- [ ] .windsurf skill mappings identified
- [ ] Migration plan for T01 noted
- [ ] Anti-pattern vigilance findings documented (or "none observed" if clear)

## Dependencies

None

## Blocker

None
