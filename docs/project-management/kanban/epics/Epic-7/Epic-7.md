## Overview

Epic 7 provides the organizational structure for all codebase maintenance and review work. This epic encompasses addressing IDE-flagged issues (errors, warnings, info), code quality standards, maintenance workflows, and continuous codebase health monitoring. It ensures that the codebase remains healthy, maintainable, and free of technical debt through systematic maintenance practices.

This epic works in conjunction with Epic 4 (Kanban Framework) to provide a complete maintenance task tracking system, ensuring that maintenance work is properly organized, prioritized, and tracked.

---

## Goals

1. **Maintain Codebase Health:** Establish systematic processes for addressing IDE-flagged issues and maintaining code quality
2. **Standardize Maintenance Workflows:** Define consistent patterns and processes for codebase maintenance tasks
3. **Enable Quality Monitoring:** Provide frameworks and tools for monitoring codebase health and quality metrics
4. **Automate Maintenance Tasks:** Develop automation and tooling to streamline maintenance work and reduce manual effort

## Stories

### Story 1: Codebase Maintenance Tasks

**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-20 (v0.7.6.2+2 – Story 6 Task 2 complete)

**Goal:** Establish systematic processes for addressing IDE-flagged issues and organizing codebase maintenance work.

**Tasks:**

- **E7:S01:T01** – PERPETUAL: Address IDE-Flagged Error, Warning, and Info level problems
- **E7:S01:T02** – COMPLETE: Create maintenance task prioritization framework
- **E7:S01:T05** – PERPETUAL: Markdown Maintenance (first maintenance cycle completed v0.7.1.5+2)
- [ ] **E7:S01:T06** – Implement Update Changelog Workflow (UCW) – TODO (v0.7.1.5+6 – Implement workflow + tooling enforcing latest-only changelog policy, archival automation, RW integration per FR-057)

**Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E7:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone).

**Forensic Marker Format:** `COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `COMPLETE (v0.7.1.3+1)`). Perpetual tasks are ongoing and should be tracked with version markers for each maintenance cycle or batch of work. Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Perpetual task established for IDE-flagged issues
- Maintenance task prioritization framework documented
- Maintenance workflow processes documented
- Integration with Epic 4 (Kanban Framework) established

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**

- Epic 4 (Kanban Framework) - Uses Kanban for tracking maintenance tasks
- Epic 2 (Workflow Management) - May use workflows for maintenance automation
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Safe (can develop independently)

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**

- None

**Blocked By:**

- None

**Coordinates With:**

- **Epic 4 (Kanban Framework):** Uses Kanban for tracking maintenance tasks
- **Epic 2 (Workflow Management):** May use workflows for maintenance automation
- **Epic 3 (Versioning):** Tracks maintenance work with version markers
- **Epic 6 (BR Implementation):** May convert IDE-flagged issues to Bug Reports when appropriate

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Maintenance tasks may be deprioritized if not systematically tracked  
  **Mitigation:** Establish perpetual task for IDE-flagged issues and integrate with Kanban framework

- **Risk:** Lack of code review standards may lead to inconsistent code quality  
  **Mitigation:** Establish code review standards early (Story 2) and integrate with development workflow

- **Risk:** Code quality metrics may not be actionable without proper tooling  
  **Mitigation:** Develop automation and tooling (Story 4) to make metrics actionable
