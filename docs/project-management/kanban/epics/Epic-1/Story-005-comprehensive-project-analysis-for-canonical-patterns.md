## Overview

This story conducts a comprehensive analysis of ALL projects in `/Users/rms/Documents/projects` to identify patterns, good practices, and anti-patterns that will inform the canonical structures for ai-dev-kit's "golden pre-release version". The analysis covers 10 dimensions across ~21 projects to ensure canonical structures are informed by real-world usage patterns.

**Related Work:**
- Framework: `docs/Analysis/comprehensive-project-analysis-framework.md`
- Strategy: `docs/Analysis/pre-analysis-completion-strategy.md`
- Completion Plan: `docs/Analysis/critical-framework-completion-plan.md`

---

## Goal

Analyze all projects to extract patterns, identify good and bad practices, and design canonical structures that will form the foundation of ai-dev-kit's "golden pre-release version" for UAT rollout.

**Outcome:** A "golden pre-release version" of ai-dev-kit that:
- Incorporates proven patterns from real-world usage
- Documents anti-patterns to prevent repetition
- Provides canonical structures informed by actual project needs
- Enables UAT rollout to other projects
