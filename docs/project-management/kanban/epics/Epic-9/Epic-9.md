## Overview

This epic addresses the critical gap between current project state (RC=0, development phase, no M/S priority tasks) and true Release Candidate (RC=1) readiness. The work involves comprehensive framework reviews, installation scenario analysis, migration path documentation, and strategic prioritization to move the project from development to release candidate state.

**Problem Statement:**
- Current state shows no M (Must Have) or S (Should Have) priority tasks, suggesting readiness
- However, project is at RC=0 (development phase), indicating we're not actually ready
- Need to understand the gap and create a clear path to RC=1

**Solution:**
- Comprehensive gap analysis to understand current vs RC=1 state
- Framework-by-framework RC readiness reviews covering:
  - Package management (how packages are managed)
  - Package maintenance (how packages are maintained)
  - Package installation (how packages are installed, including all scenarios)
- Canonical E/S/T structure review and refinement
- Strategic prioritization and roadmap creation

---

## Goals

1. **Understand the Gap:** Identify exactly what's missing or mis-prioritized for RC=1 readiness
2. **Framework Readiness:** Review each packaged framework for RC readiness covering:
   - **Framework Review:**
     - Main objective and purpose
     - Documentation completeness and quality
     - Component analysis (justification, definition, behavior validation)
   - **Package Management:** How the framework package is managed (versioning, dependencies, updates)
   - **Package Maintenance:** How the framework package is maintained (bug fixes, updates, support)
   - **Package Installation:**
     - Clean install into new project
     - Active project installation:
       - File location detection relative to target project structure
       - Data backup procedures
       - Data mapping from old structure to installed framework
   - **Update Management:** How to manage AI Dev Kit updates in target projects
3. **Canonical Structure Review:** Review and refine core and extended canonical E/S/T sets
4. **Strategic Prioritization:** Elevate critical work to M/S priority and create roadmap to RC=1
5. **Documentation Completeness:** Ensure all framework review, package management, maintenance, and installation scenarios are documented
6. **Book Project Integration:** Identify tie-in opportunities for the accompanying book project

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- Strategic release planning decisions
- Framework release readiness
- RC=1 state transition
- Task prioritization corrections

**Blocked By:**
- None (can start immediately)

**Coordinates With:**
- **Epic 5 (Documentation Management):** Documentation completeness for frameworks
- **Epic 6 (Framework Management):** Framework health and versioning
- **Epic 7 (Codebase Maintenance):** Code quality and review
- **Epic 8 (Tooling & Automation):** Automation and tooling readiness
- **All Framework Epics (1-4):** Framework-specific readiness reviews

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Scope Creep:** Framework reviews could expand beyond RC readiness → Define clear RC readiness criteria upfront
- **Prioritization Conflicts:** Elevating tasks to M/S may conflict with current priorities → Use evidence-based analysis
- **Missing Work Discovery:** May discover significant missing work → Create phased approach, prioritize critical gaps
- **Timeline Uncertainty:** RC readiness timeline may be longer than expected → Create realistic roadmap with milestones
