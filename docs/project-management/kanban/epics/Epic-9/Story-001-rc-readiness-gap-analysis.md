## Overview

Investigate and document the gap between current project state (RC=0, no M/S priority tasks) and true Release Candidate (RC=1) state, identifying mis-prioritized work, missing tasks, and creating a roadmap to release readiness.

**Framework Review Scope Awareness:**
This gap analysis must be aware of the comprehensive framework review scope defined for E9:S02-S04, which includes:
- **Framework Review:** Main objective, documentation, component analysis (justification, definition, behavior validation)
- **Package Management:** How packages are managed (versioning, dependencies, updates, distribution)
- **Package Maintenance:** How packages are maintained (bug fixes, updates, support, lifecycle)
- **Package Installation:** Clean install and active project installation (file location detection, backup procedures, data mapping)
- **Update Management:** How to manage AI Dev Kit updates in target projects
- **Book Project Integration:** Tie-in opportunities for the accompanying book project

---

## Goals

- [ ] Document current project state comprehensively (all epics, stories, tasks, priorities, completion status)
- [ ] Define RC=1 criteria and requirements (what constitutes release candidate state)
- [ ] Perform gap analysis (current state vs RC=1 requirements)
- [ ] Review all active tasks for proper prioritization (identify mis-prioritized M/S work)
- [ ] Identify missing critical work (tasks that should exist but don't)
- [ ] Create RC readiness checklist (comprehensive criteria for RC=1)
- [ ] Develop roadmap to RC=1 (prioritized path with milestones and dependencies)

**Task Document:** [`Story-001-rc-readiness-gap-analysis/T04-task-prioritization-review.md`](Story-001-rc-readiness-gap-analysis/T04-task-prioritization-review.md)

### Task 5: Missing Work Identification

**Brief Summary:** Discover critical work that doesn't have tasks yet but is required for RC=1 state, with task creation recommendations.

**Task Document:** [`Story-001-rc-readiness-gap-analysis/T05-missing-work-identification.md`](Story-001-rc-readiness-gap-analysis/T05-missing-work-identification.md)

### Task 6: RC Readiness Checklist Creation

**Brief Summary:** Create comprehensive RC readiness checklist with all criteria, quality gates, and validation requirements. **Must include framework review checklist items** covering all dimensions (framework review, package management/maintenance/installation, update management, book project integration).

**Key Areas:**
- Framework review checklist items (objective, documentation, component analysis)
- Package management/maintenance/installation checklist items
- Update management checklist items
- Book project integration checklist items
- Quality gates and validation requirements
- Per-framework checklist templates

**Task Document:** [`Story-001-rc-readiness-gap-analysis/T06-rc-readiness-checklist-creation.md`](Story-001-rc-readiness-gap-analysis/T06-rc-readiness-checklist-creation.md)

### Task 7: Roadmap to RC=1

**Brief Summary:** Develop actionable roadmap showing prioritized path from current state to RC=1, with milestones, dependencies, and timeline estimates.

**Task Document:** [`Story-001-rc-readiness-gap-analysis/T07-roadmap-to-rc1.md`](Story-001-rc-readiness-gap-analysis/T07-roadmap-to-rc1.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Criterion 1:** Current state comprehensively documented (all epics, stories, tasks, priorities)
- [ ] **Criterion 2:** RC=1 criteria clearly defined with measurable requirements
- [ ] **Criterion 3:** Gap analysis completed showing specific differences between current and RC=1 state
- [ ] **Criterion 4:** All active tasks reviewed and re-prioritization recommendations provided
- [ ] **Criterion 5:** Missing critical work identified with task creation recommendations
- [ ] **Criterion 6:** RC readiness checklist created with all criteria
- [ ] **Criterion 7:** Roadmap to RC=1 created with milestones, dependencies, and timeline estimates
- [ ] **Criterion 8:** Gap analysis document completed with actionable recommendations

---

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- [FR-032: Release Candidate Readiness Gap Analysis](../../fr-br/FR-032-release-candidate-readiness-gap-analysis.md) (provides context and requirements)

**Blocks:**
- Strategic release planning decisions
- Task prioritization corrections
- Missing task creation
- RC readiness assessment
- Framework RC readiness reviews (E9:S02-S04)

**Blocked By:**
- None (can start immediately)

**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe because this is an investigation/analysis task that does not modify core code.

## Notes

**Investigation Approach:**
1. **Current State Inventory:** Catalog all epics, stories, tasks, priorities, and statuses
2. **RC Criteria Definition:** Research and define what RC=1 means for this project, **including comprehensive framework review criteria** (framework objective/documentation/component analysis, package management/maintenance/installation, update management, book project integration)
3. **Gap Identification:** Compare current state to RC=1 requirements **across all framework review dimensions**
4. **Prioritization Review:** Analyze task priorities and identify mis-classifications
5. **Missing Work Discovery:** Identify gaps in task coverage **across all framework review areas**
6. **Roadmap Development:** Create actionable path to RC=1 **that addresses all framework review requirements**

**Success Metrics:**
- Comprehensive understanding of current state
- Clear definition of RC=1 criteria
- Specific gap identification with actionable items
- Prioritization corrections identified
- Missing work documented
- Clear roadmap to RC=1

**Key Principles:**
- **Evidence-Based:** All recommendations must be supported by analysis
- **Actionable:** Gap analysis must lead to specific tasks/actions
- **Comprehensive:** Must cover all active work, not just selected areas
- **Realistic:** Roadmap must be achievable, not aspirational
- **Prioritized:** Recommendations must be prioritized (M/S/C/W)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Clear understanding of why there are no M/S tasks
- Identification of tasks that should be M/S
- Discovery of missing critical work **across all framework review dimensions**
- RC=1 criteria that includes **comprehensive framework review requirements**
- RC readiness checklist that covers **all framework review areas** (framework review, package management/maintenance/installation, update management, book project integration)
- Roadmap showing path to RC=1 **that addresses framework review gaps**
- Prioritization corrections to apply
- Strategic planning foundation **informed by framework review scope**
