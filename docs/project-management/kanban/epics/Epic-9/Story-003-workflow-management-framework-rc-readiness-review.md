  - Data structure analysis
  - Migration mapping strategies
  - Data transformation procedures
  - Validation and verification

### Task 7: Update Management in Target Projects

**Brief Summary:** Document how to manage AI Dev Kit updates in target projects, including update detection, installation, and rollback procedures.

**Key Areas:**
- Update detection and notification
- Update installation procedures
- Version compatibility checking
- Update rollback procedures
- Update impact assessment
- Configuration migration during updates

### Task 8: Book Project Tie-in Opportunities

**Brief Summary:** Identify and document tie-in opportunities for the accompanying book project, including examples, case studies, and teaching moments.

**Key Areas:**
- Framework review examples for book
- Installation scenario examples
- Migration case studies
- Best practices documentation
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Teaching moments and exercises

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- [E9:S01: RC Readiness Gap Analysis](Story-001-rc-readiness-gap-analysis.md) (provides gap analysis context)

**Blocks:**
- Workflow Management Framework RC=1 release
- Framework installation and adoption
- User onboarding and migration

**Blocked By:**
- None (can start after E9:S01 gap analysis)

**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe because this is a review/documentation task.

## Version Anchor

**Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.9.3.7+1)`)

**When Story is Complete:**
- Add forensic marker to Story document
- Update `Last updated` field
- Update `Completed` field
- Update `Status` to `COMPLETE`
- Update `Version` to final version
- Update `Epic-9` with completion status and version
- Update `kanban-board.md` with completion status and version

## Notes

**Review Approach:**
1. **Package Management:** Analyze current package management processes, identify gaps, document requirements
2. **Package Maintenance:** Analyze current maintenance processes, identify gaps, document requirements
3. **Installation Scenarios:** Test and document each installation scenario, validate procedures
4. **Framework Integration:** Test and document integration with other frameworks
5. **Edge Cases:** Identify and document edge cases, test error handling
6. **Documentation:** Review all documentation for completeness and accuracy

**Key Considerations:**
- **Workflow Integration:** Framework must integrate seamlessly with Kanban and Versioning frameworks
- **Migration Paths:** Need clear procedures for migrating from existing workflow systems
- **State Management:** Workflow state must be preserved during migration
- **Documentation:** All scenarios must be clearly documented with examples

**Success Metrics:**
- All package management processes documented
- All package maintenance processes documented
- All installation scenarios tested and documented
- Framework integration validated
- Edge cases identified and handled
- Documentation complete and accessible
- RC readiness assessment completed
