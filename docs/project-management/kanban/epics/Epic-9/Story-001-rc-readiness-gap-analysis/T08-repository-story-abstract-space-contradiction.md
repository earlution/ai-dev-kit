# Epic 9, Story 1, Task 8: Repository Story Abstract Space Contradiction

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-17 (v0.9.1.8+9 – Final validation complete: Kanban board S00→S01 references fixed, versioning policy E6:S06→E6:S07 corrected, acceptance criteria marked complete)  
**Started:** 2026-01-16  
**Completed:** 2026-01-17  
**Version:** v0.9.1.8+9  
**Code:** E9S01T08

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`

**Full Task ID:** `E9:S01:T08`

---

## Scope

Analyze and resolve the fundamental architectural contradiction where S00 (repository stories) is defined as abstract space (`v0.5.0.0+0`) but contains concrete tasks (`v0.5.0.31+0`), breaking the abstract space concept. Design solution for separating abstract space from repository stories, define reserved range for perpetual tasks, and create migration strategy.

**Problem Statement:**
- S00 is defined as abstract space (`0.5.0.0+0`) - conceptual anchor only
- S00 has concrete tasks (`0.5.0.31+0`, `0.6.0.33+0`) - making it a real story
- This violates abstract space principle - cannot have both abstract space AND concrete tasks
- No reserved range defined for perpetual tasks (UKW, CMW, etc.)
- "Perpetual story" concept may be unnecessary

**Solution:**
- Analyze contradiction and design solution
- Define reserved range for perpetual tasks (with pros/cons analysis)
- Separate abstract space from repository stories
- Create migration strategy for existing repository tasks
- Update versioning and Kanban policies

---

- **FR-021:** FR/BR/UXR Repository Stories (S00 Pattern)
- **Versioning Policy:** `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/dev-kit-versioning-policy.md`
- **Kanban Policy:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`
- **Current Repository Stories:**

  - E6:S00 (BR Repo) with tasks T33, etc.
  - E7:S00 (UXR Repo)

## Deliverable

**Solution Design Document** covering:

   - Pros/cons analysis of each approach
   - Recommended approach with rationale
   - Migration strategy for existing perpetual tasks

3. **Migration Strategy:**

## Approach

1. **Analysis Phase:**
   - Review analysis document
   - Identify all contradictions and edge cases
   - Document current state (all repository stories and tasks)

2. **Perpetual Task Range Analysis:**
   - Define range options: T01-T09, T10-T19, T91-T99, T101+, etc.
   - Analyze pros/cons for each option
   - Consider scalability, migration complexity, clarity
   - Select recommended approach

3. **Solution Design:**
   - Design abstract space separation (S00 → Epic-level only)
   - Design repository story structure (S01 for repositories)
   - Design perpetual task allocation (reserved range)
   - Design task numbering for repository tasks

4. **Migration Strategy:**
   - Plan repository story migration (S00 → S01)
   - Plan task renumbering (with offset calculation)
   - Plan version number updates
   - Plan traceability preservation

5. **Policy Updates:**
   - Define versioning policy changes
   - Define Kanban policy changes
   - Define FR-018/FR-021 documentation updates

---

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- Analysis document completion
- Understanding of current repository structure
- Versioning policy review
- Kanban policy review

**Blocks:**
- Repository story migration
- Perpetual task policy definition
- Versioning policy updates
- Kanban policy updates

**Blocked By:**
- None (can start immediately)

**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe because this is analysis and design work that doesn't modify core code.

## Notes

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. What is the best reserved range for perpetual tasks? (T01-T09, T91-T99, T101+, etc.)
2. How many perpetual tasks are expected per story?
3. What happens when reserved range is exhausted?
4. Should perpetual tasks be story-specific or epic-wide?
5. How to handle migration of existing perpetual tasks?

**Design Principles:**
- Preserve abstract space concept (FR-018)
- Maintain repository pattern (FR-021) but as concrete story
- Provide clear separation of concerns
- Ensure scalability (100+ tasks = epic split)
- Minimize migration complexity
