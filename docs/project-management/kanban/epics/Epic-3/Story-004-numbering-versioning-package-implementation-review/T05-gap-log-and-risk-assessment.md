# E3:S04:T05 – Create Gap Log and Risk Assessment

**Task ID:** E3:S04:T05  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Epic:** E3 – Numbering & Versioning Framework  
**Story:** E3:S04 – Numbering & Versioning Package Implementation Review  
**Version Anchor:** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.3.4.5+1)

---

## Scope

Consolidate all findings from **T01–T04** into a single **gap log and risk assessment** for the Numbering & Versioning framework implementation. This includes:

- Enumerating any structural, behavioral, or integration gaps discovered during the Numbering & Versioning package implementation review
- Classifying each gap by **severity**, **likelihood**, and **RC impact**
- Explicitly distinguishing between:
  - **Numbering & Versioning framework implementation gaps**, and
  - **External workflow behavior gaps** (e.g., RW behavior) that are tracked elsewhere

---

## Inputs

- **E3:S04:T01 – Expectations baseline for Numbering & Versioning package**
- **E3:S04:T02 – Component inventory and mapping to expectations**
- **E3:S04:T03 – Versioning behavior validation report**
- **E3:S04:T04 – Integration and dependency alignment report**

---

## Deliverable

A **gap log and risk assessment** that:

- Lists all identified gaps with:
  - Description
  - Category (Structural / Behavioral / Integration / Process / Operational)
  - Severity (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
  - Likelihood (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
  - RC Impact (BLOCKER / NON-BLOCKING / INFORMATIONAL)
  - Ownership (Numbering & Versioning package vs external workflow)
  - Tracking reference (BR/FR/Task)
- Summarizes overall RC risk posture for the **Numbering & Versioning framework package**

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All relevant findings from **T01–T04** are reviewed and distilled into a single gap log ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Each gap is classified with **severity**, **likelihood**, and **RC impact** ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Gaps that belong to **external workflows (e.g., RW)** are clearly separated from **Numbering & Versioning package implementation gaps** ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Overall RC risk posture for the Numbering & Versioning package is documented ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] References to BR/FR/Task IDs are included for each gap (where applicable) ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Approach

1. **Synthesize Inputs from T01–T04**
   - Review expectations baseline (T01) and component inventory (T02)
   - Cross-check behavioral validation (T03) and integration alignment (T04)
2. **Identify Gaps**
   - Note any discrepancies, missing coverage, or process weaknesses
   - Include both direct Numbering & Versioning package issues and closely-related workflow issues
3. **Classify and Assess Risk**
   - Assign severity, likelihood, and RC impact per gap
   - Distinguish Numbering & Versioning package issues from external workflow issues
4. **Summarize RC Readiness**
   - Provide a clear statement on whether any identified gaps **block RC sign-off** for the Numbering & Versioning framework

## Gap Log

### Summary of Direct Numbering & Versioning Package Gaps

From **T01–T04**:

- **T01 (Expectations Baseline):** No missing expectations detected relative to current Numbering & Versioning README + policy documents. All expected behaviors, schemas, and constraints documented.
- **T02 (Component Inventory):** All 14 expected components verified present and complete (100% coverage). No gaps or missing components identified.
- **T03 (Behavioral Validation):** All validation points marked **PASS**; no schema rules, edge cases, or guidance consistency discrepancies identified. No gaps or missing behaviors found.
- **T04 (Integration & Dependency Alignment):** Integration and dependency alignment assessed as **COMPLIANT / RC-READY**. All integration points validated and aligned.

**Conclusion:**  
No **direct Numbering & Versioning framework implementation gaps** were identified that would block RC sign-off. All components are present, behaviors match documentation, and integrations are aligned.

---

### Gap 1 – Schema Customization Documentation (Informational)

- **ID:** GAP-VERSIONING-CUSTOM-001  
- **Category:** Process / Documentation  
- **Description:**  
  - Projects using custom version schemas (different from `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`) need to update validation scripts and workflow configurations
  - This is an expected customization requirement, not a gap in the package itself
  - Documentation exists in integration guides, but could be more prominent
- **Source:**  
  - T04 integration review identified this as a "potential consideration"
  - Integration guides document customization requirements
- **Ownership:**  
  - **Numbering & Versioning package documentation** (enhancement opportunity)
- **Severity:** LOW  
- **Likelihood:** LOW (most projects will use standard schema)  
- **RC Impact:** INFORMATIONAL  
  - Reason: This is an expected customization path, not a defect. Documentation exists but could be more prominent.
- **Tracking:**  
  - Enhancement opportunity (not blocking RC)
  - Could be addressed in future documentation improvements

---

### Gap 2 – Path Configuration Documentation (Informational)

- **ID:** GAP-VERSIONING-CONFIG-001  
- **Category:** Process / Documentation  
- **Description:**  
  - Projects using non-standard paths (different from `src/{project}/version.py`) need to configure `rw-config.yaml`
  - This is an expected configuration requirement, not a gap in the package itself
  - Documentation exists in integration guides and `rw-config.yaml` schema
- **Source:**  
  - T04 integration review identified this as a "potential consideration"
  - Integration guides and config schema document path configuration
- **Ownership:**  
  - **Numbering & Versioning package documentation** (enhancement opportunity)
- **Severity:** LOW  
- **Likelihood:** LOW (most projects will use standard paths)  
- **RC Impact:** INFORMATIONAL  
  - Reason: This is an expected configuration path, not a defect. Documentation exists but could be more prominent.
- **Tracking:**  
  - Enhancement opportunity (not blocking RC)
  - Could be addressed in future documentation improvements

---

### Gap 3 – SemVer Mapping Complexity (Informational)

- **ID:** GAP-VERSIONING-SEMVER-001  
- **Category:** Process / Documentation  
- **Description:**  
  - Projects with complex Epic/Story structures may need custom SemVer mapping beyond the Hybrid Approach algorithm
  - The Hybrid Approach algorithm is documented and works for most cases
  - Edge cases with very complex structures may require custom mapping logic
- **Source:**  
  - T04 integration review identified this as a "potential consideration"
  - SemVer converter script and registry system documented
- **Ownership:**  
  - **Numbering & Versioning package documentation** (enhancement opportunity)
- **Severity:** LOW  
- **Likelihood:** LOW (most projects will have standard Epic/Story structures)  
- **RC Impact:** INFORMATIONAL  
  - Reason: This is an expected edge case, not a defect. Hybrid Approach algorithm covers most use cases, and custom mapping is possible.
- **Tracking:**  
  - Enhancement opportunity (not blocking RC)
  - Could be addressed in future documentation improvements or examples

---

### Summary of External Workflow Gaps (Not Package Issues)

The following gaps are **not** attributable to the Numbering & Versioning package itself:

- **RW Validation Script Behavior:** Some validation scripts may have edge cases (e.g., task document detection patterns), but these are workflow tooling issues, not versioning policy issues
- **Changelog Ordering Warnings:** Changelog ordering violations are workflow/process issues, not versioning schema issues (canonical ordering principle is correctly documented)

**Conclusion:**  
All identified "gaps" are either:
- **Expected customization paths** (schema customization, path configuration, SemVer mapping)
- **External workflow tooling issues** (not package defects)
- **Documentation enhancement opportunities** (not blocking RC)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Overall RC Risk Posture (Numbering & Versioning Framework Package)

- **Structural Risk:** ✅ **NONE**  
  - Package structure, policies, templates, and integration guides are complete and aligned with expectations (100% component coverage)

- **Behavioral Risk:** ✅ **NONE**  
  - Behavioral validation (T03) found no discrepancies in versioning behavior. All schema rules, edge cases, and guidance consistency validated as PASS.

- **Integration Risk:** ✅ **NONE**  
  - Integrations with Workflow Management (RW) and Kanban are aligned and validated. All integration points confirmed working correctly.

- **Documentation Risk:** ⚠️ **LOW**  
  - Documentation is complete and accurate. Some customization paths could be more prominent, but all required information is present.

- **Operational Risk:** ✅ **NONE**  
  - No operational dependencies or environment configuration issues identified. Package is pure documentation with no runtime dependencies.

**RC Impact Conclusion:**  
There are **no RC-blocking risks** attributable to the **Numbering & Versioning framework package** implementation. All components are present, behaviors match documentation, integrations are aligned, and any identified "gaps" are expected customization paths or documentation enhancement opportunities, not defects.
