## Task Checklist

- [x] **E6:S06:T01 – FR/BR/UXR Prioritization Board Implementation** - ✅ COMPLETED (HIGH priority, Create prioritization board for FRs, BRs, and UXRs with identical structure to Kanban board)
  - Task: [`T01-fr-br-uxr-prioritization-board.md`](Story-006-feature-requests/T01-fr-br-uxr-prioritization-board.md)

- [x] **E6:S06:T02 – Fix Release Workflow Micromanagement Issues** - 🔄 IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED (CRITICAL, User pain and frustration with tool discovery, pattern matching failures, and excessive manual intervention; blocking productive work. Root cause identified as Cascade whitelist security prompts.)
  - Task: [`T02-fix-release-workflow-micromanagement-issues.md`](Story-006-feature-requests/T02-fix-release-workflow-micromanagement-issues.md) | [BR-038](../../fr-br/BR-038-release-workflow-micromanagement-and-tool-discovery-issues.md)

- [x] **E6:S06:T03 – Investigate Apple SDK License Blocking Issue** - ✅ COMPLETED (HIGH priority, Apple SDK license blocking issue prevents proper installation or usage of ai-dev-kit components on Apple platforms; needs investigation to understand root cause and implement solution)
  - Task: [`T03-apple-sdk-license-blocking-issue.md`](Story-006-feature-requests/T03-apple-sdk-license-blocking-issue.md) | [BR-040](../../fr-br/BR-040-apple-sdk-license-blocking-issue.md)

- [x] **E6:S06:T41 – Windsurf: Investigate how to leverage AGENTS.md and SKILL.md for workflows** - ✅ COMPLETED (CRITICAL, Implement AGENTS.md and SKILL.md to define specialized workflow agents and capabilities, enabling Cascade to execute workflows autonomously without manual intervention.

## Overview

This story tracks all feature requests related to framework management, installation tools, update mechanisms, and related framework management processes. Feature requests are converted into tasks following the FR/BR → Task → Story → Epic flow defined in the Kanban governance policy.

**Perpetual Story:** This is a perpetual maintenance story that never completes. New feature requests will create new tasks under this story. The story remains IN PROGRESS even when all current tasks are complete, as feature request tracking is an ongoing activity.

---

## Goal

Systematically track, prioritize, and implement feature requests for framework packages, installation tools, update mechanisms, and related framework management processes.
