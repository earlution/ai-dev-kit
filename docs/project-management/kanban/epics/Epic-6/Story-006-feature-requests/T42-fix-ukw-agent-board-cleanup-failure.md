# Task T42 – Fix UKW Agent Board Cleanup Failure

**Task ID:** E6:S06:T42  
**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium (2.5 days)  
**Created:** 2026-03-11  
**Version:** v0.6.6.41+1  

**Associated BR:** [BR-042](../../../fr-br/BR-042-ukw-agent-board-cleanup-failure.md)

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`

**Full Task ID:** `E6:S06:T42`

**Repository Pattern:** BR-042 = E6:S06:T42 (abstract space: v0.6.6.41+1)

---

## Scope

Fix the UKW Agent's board cleanup functionality to ensure completed tasks are properly removed from active MoSCOW sections, enabling truly autonomous kanban board maintenance.

**Problem Statement:**
- UKW Agent successfully updates task statuses but leaves completed tasks in active MoSCOW sections
- Board cleanup requires manual intervention, defeating the purpose of autonomous workflows
- Active sections become cluttered with completed work, reducing clarity

**Solution:**
- Update ukw-sync skill to include board cleanup step
- Enhance UKW Agent logic for proper task removal
- Add validation to ensure active sections only contain active work
- Implement archival process for completed tasks

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] UKW workflow automatically removes COMPLETED tasks from active MoSCOW sections
- [ ] Board cleanup happens without manual intervention
- [ ] Active sections contain only IN PROGRESS/TODO tasks after UKW execution
- [ ] Completed tasks are properly archived or referenced in kanban-completed.md

### Quality Requirements  
- [ ] No regressions in UKW status inference capabilities
- [ ] Board cleanup preserves important task information
- [ ] Cleanup process is reliable and consistent across multiple executions
- [ ] Users can trust autonomous board maintenance without verification

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] UKW Agent coordination with other agents remains functional
- [ ] Board cleanup integrates properly with existing workflow infrastructure
- [ ] Changes are backward compatible with current kanban board structure

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design (0.5 days)
- Review current ukw-sync skill implementation
- Identify missing board cleanup logic
- Design cleanup algorithm and archival strategy
- Plan integration with existing UKW workflow

### Phase 2: Skill Enhancement (1 day)
- Add Step 6: Board Cleanup to ukw-sync skill
- Implement task filtering logic (COMPLETED vs active)
- Create archival process for completed tasks
- Add validation checks for board organization

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (0.5 days)
- Test board cleanup with completed tasks (E6:S06:T41, E6:S06:T03)
- Validate no regressions in status inference
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify integration with UKW Agent coordination

### Phase 4: Documentation (0.5 days)
- Update ukw-sync skill documentation
- Enhance UKW Agent capabilities description
- Document board cleanup process and policies
- Update kanban board guide if needed

---

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify
- **Primary:** `/.windsurf/skills/ukw-sync/SKILL.md` (add board cleanup step)
- **Secondary:** `/docs/project-management/kanban/AGENTS.md` (update UKW Agent description)
- **Optional:** Create `/.windsurf/skills/board-cleanup/SKILL.md` (dedicated cleanup skill)

### Key Logic Changes
```markdown
### Step 6: Board Cleanup (NEW)
- Filter COMPLETED tasks from active MoSCOW sections
- Archive completed tasks to kanban-completed.md
- Validate active sections contain only IN PROGRESS/TODO tasks
- Update board organization to reflect current work priorities
```

### Integration Points
- Works with existing UKW Agent coordination patterns
- Leverages current status inference capabilities
- Integrates with kanban board structure and validation
- Supports archival and documentation workflows

---

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **UKW Agent** - Must maintain coordination capabilities during cleanup
- **Status Inference** - Cleanup must rely on accurate task status detection
- **Kanban Infrastructure** - Must work with existing board structure
- **Documentation Agent** - For archival and reference updates

### External Dependencies
- **Windsurf Skill System** - Must support enhanced ukw-sync skill
- **MCP Integration** - Agent communication during cleanup process
- **Git Integration** - For committing board cleanup changes

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **Data Loss** - Accidental removal of active tasks during cleanup
- **Regressions** - Breaking existing UKW status inference capabilities
- **Performance Issues** - Cleanup process slowing down UKW execution

### Medium Risks
- **Integration Complexity** - Cleanup logic interfering with agent coordination
- **Archival Issues** - Incomplete or incorrect task archival process
- **User Confusion** - Changes to board organization affecting user experience

### Low Risks
- **Documentation Overhead** - Additional documentation requirements
- **Testing Complexity** - Additional test cases needed for cleanup functionality
- **Maintenance Burden** - Ongoing maintenance of cleanup logic

---

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
- **100% Automation:** No manual intervention required for board cleanup
- **Zero Regressions:** All existing UKW capabilities preserved
- **Complete Coverage:** All completed tasks properly removed from active sections
- **Reliable Execution:** Consistent cleanup behavior across multiple runs

### Quality Success
- **User Trust:** Users can rely on autonomous board maintenance
- **Board Clarity:** Active sections clearly show only current work
- **Information Preservation:** Completed task information properly archived
- **Performance:** Cleanup process completes quickly without overhead

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test board cleanup logic with various task combinations
- Validate filtering of COMPLETED vs active tasks
- Test archival process and reference creation
- Verify error handling and edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test UKW workflow with enhanced cleanup step

### Related Features
- **FR-041** - AGENTS.md and SKILL.md for workflows (foundational capability)
- **FR-010** - Implement actual agentic intelligence task mapping

### Perpetual Task Context
This task addresses a **specific defect** in the UKW Agent system. After completion, ongoing UKW maintenance and improvements should be attributed to **E6:S07:T101** (UKW Perpetual Task). This follows the established pattern where:
- **T42** - Specific bug fixes and one-time improvements  
- **T101** - Ongoing perpetual maintenance and routine UKW operations

### Integration with Perpetual Task
Once T42 is complete, the enhanced UKW Agent with proper board cleanup will support the perpetual maintenance work tracked in T101, ensuring autonomous kanban maintenance without manual intervention.
