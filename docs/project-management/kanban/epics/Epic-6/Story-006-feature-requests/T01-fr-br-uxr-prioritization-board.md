# Task T01 – FR/BR/UXR Prioritization Board Implementation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium (3 days)  
**Created:** 2026-03-09  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-09  
**Version:** v0.6.7.107+1  
**Code:** E6:S06:T01  
**Associated FR:** [FR-051](../../../fr-br/FR-051-fr-br-uxr-prioritization-board.md)

---

## Task Overview

Implement an FR/BR/UXR Prioritization Board with identical responsibility structure to the Kanban board, specifically for managing open FRs (Feature Requests), BRs (Bug Reports), and UXRs (User Experience Research items).

**Problem:** No centralized board for prioritizing FRs, BRs, and UXRs, leading to lack of visibility and systematic prioritization.

**Solution:** Create a prioritization board system with main board and completed tracking, identical to Kanban board structure.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality:
1. ✅ **Main Board Created** - Functional `fr-br-uxr-board.md` with prioritized FR/BR/UXR list
2. ✅ **Completed Board Created** - Functional `fr-br-uxr-completed.md` for historical tracking
3. ✅ **Priority System** - Clear priority levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) and status tracking
4. ✅ **Document Integration** - Links to all existing FR/BR/UXR documents in `/fr-br/` directory
5. ✅ **Kanban Integration** - Cross-references to associated Kanban tasks

### Structure Requirements:

1. ✅ **Identical Structure** - Same responsibility model as Kanban board
2. ✅ **Clear Sections** - Critical, High, Medium, Low priority sections
3. ✅ **Status Tracking** - TODO, IN PROGRESS, UNDER REVIEW, AWAITING INFO
4. ✅ **Completion Tracking** - Historical reference for completed items
5. ✅ **Documentation** - Clear instructions and integration guides

### Integration Requirements:

1. ✅ **FR/BR/UXR Links** - Direct links to individual documents
2. ✅ **Kanban Cross-refs** - Links to implementing tasks when available
3. 🔄 **Board Updates** - Integration with intake workflow for automatic updates
4. 🔄 **Completion Sync** - Update completed board when FR/BR/UXRs are implemented

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)

- Create main FR/BR/UXR board structure (`fr-br-uxr-board.md`)
- Create completed board structure (`fr-br-uxr-completed.md`)
- Scan existing FR/BR/UXR documents in `/fr-br/` directory
- Populate main board with all open FRs, BRs, and UXRs
- Assign initial priorities based on content and dates

### Phase 2: Integration (Day 2)

- Add links to individual FR/BR/UXR documents
- Cross-reference with existing Kanban tasks where applicable
- Update Kanban board documentation to reference FR/BR/UXR board
- Create integration guide for board usage
- Test board functionality and navigation

### Phase 3: Automation (Day 3) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Integrate with intake workflow for automatic board updates
- [x] Implement completion tracking when FR/BR/UXRs are implemented
- [x] Add board update instructions to intake workflow
- [x] Final testing and validation
- [x] Create usage documentation and training materials
