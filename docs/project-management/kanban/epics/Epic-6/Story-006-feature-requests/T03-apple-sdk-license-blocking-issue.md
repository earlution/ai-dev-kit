# Task T03 – Apple SDK License Blocking Issue Investigation

**Task ID:** E6:S06:T03  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium  
**Created:** 2026-03-10  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-10  
**Version:** v0.6.6.3+1  

**Associated BR:** [BR-040](../../../fr-br/BR-040-apple-sdk-license-blocking-issue.md)

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`
**Value:** `E6:S06:T03`

---

## Overview

This task investigates and resolves the Apple SDK license blocking issue that prevents proper installation or usage of ai-dev-kit components on Apple platforms (macOS, iOS). The investigation will identify the root cause and implement appropriate solutions to ensure Apple platform compatibility.

---

## Task Objective

Investigate Apple SDK license blocking issues, identify root causes, and implement solutions to enable proper ai-dev-kit installation and usage on Apple platforms.

## Progress Log

### 2026-03-10 - Phase 1 Complete: Code Analysis and Solution Implementation

**Completed Activities:**
- [x] Comprehensive codebase analysis - No Apple SDK dependencies found in ai-dev-kit itself
- [x] Root cause hypothesis identified - Git operations on macOS trigger Xcode Command Line Tools requirements
- [x] Enhanced error handling implemented - AppleSDKLicenseError exception created
- [x] Git submodule backend updated - Apple SDK prerequisite checking and error detection
- [x] Install command updated - Apple SDK error handling integration
- [x] Apple platform setup guide created - Comprehensive user documentation
- [x] Investigation report completed - Detailed Phase 1 analysis and findings

**Key Findings:**
- ai-dev-kit is platform-agnostic Python code with no direct Apple SDK dependencies
- Apple SDK license blocking likely stems from Git operations requiring Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS
- Issue manifests when Git backends (submodule/subtree) are used on macOS systems without proper Xcode setup

**Implemented Solutions:**
1. **Enhanced Error Detection:** AppleSDKLicenseError with specific error messages and recovery suggestions
2. **Prerequisite Checking:** Automatic detection of Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS
3. **User Guidance:** Comprehensive setup guide with step-by-step instructions
4. **Alternative Paths:** Package manager backend recommendations when Git operations fail

**Next Phase:** Phase 2 - Live testing and user feedback collection when terminal issues resolved

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Issue successfully analyzed through code review
- [x] Root cause hypothesis identified (Git operations trigger Apple SDK requirements)
- [x] Solution implemented (enhanced error handling and user guidance)
- [ ] Solution tested and validated on Apple platforms (blocked by terminal issues)
- [ ] No regressions on other platforms (pending testing)
- [x] Documentation updated with Apple platform guidance
