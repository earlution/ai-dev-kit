# Epic 6, Story 6, Task 4: Create Package Management Implementation Plan

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-18 (v0.6.6.10+1 – Implementation plan complete)  
**Started:** 2025-12-18  
**Completed:** 2025-12-18  
**Version:** v0.6.6.10+1  
**Code:** E6S06T04

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`

**Full Task ID:** `E6:S06:T04`

---

## Scope

Create a detailed implementation plan for the package management system based on the prioritized recommendations from T09. This plan will break down the Phase 3 implementation (package files) into actionable tasks, define milestones, estimate effort, and provide clear guidance for implementation.

**What this task accomplishes:**
- Translates prioritized recommendations into actionable implementation tasks
- Defines phases, milestones, and success criteria
- Estimates effort and identifies dependencies
- Creates task breakdown structure for implementation
- Provides clear implementation roadmap

**Value delivered:**
- Clear implementation path from prioritization to execution
- Actionable tasks enable parallel development where possible
- Effort estimates inform resource planning
- Milestones provide progress tracking

---

## Input

- **E6:S06:T02 Deliverables:**
  - `docs/Analysis/package-management-investigation-report.md` - Investigation findings
  - `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/package-management-design.md` - Design specifications
  - `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/package-hash-verification-spec.md` - Security specifications

- **E6:S06:T09 Deliverable:**
  - `docs/Analysis/package-management-prioritization-review.md` - Prioritized recommendations, roadmap, quick wins, resource assessment

- **Project Context:**
  - Current framework structure (`packages/frameworks/`)
  - Existing CLI tool plans (Phase 2 - E6:S02)
  - Release workflow integration points

---

## Deliverable

**Implementation Plan Document** (`docs/Analysis/package-management-implementation-plan.md`) with:
- Detailed phase breakdown (Phase 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
- Task breakdown for each phase
- Effort estimates per task
- Dependencies and blockers
- Milestones and success criteria
- Implementation sequence and parallel opportunities
- Testing strategy
- Integration points (CLI tool, release workflow, GitHub releases)

---

## Approach

1. **Phase Breakdown:**
   - Use T09 prioritization roadmap as foundation
   - Break Phase 3.1-3.3 into detailed tasks
   - Define task dependencies and sequence

2. **Task Definition:**
   - Package builder implementation tasks
   - Hash verification implementation tasks
   - Distribution integration tasks
   - Installation and CLI integration tasks

3. **Effort Estimation:**
   - Use T09 resource assessment as baseline
   - Break down into individual task estimates
   - Account for testing and integration

4. **Milestone Definition:**
   - Clear success criteria per milestone
   - Progress tracking checkpoints
   - Integration validation points

5. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Unit testing requirements
   - Integration testing requirements
   - Validation testing (hash verification, package integrity)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implementation phases broken down into actionable tasks ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Each task has clear scope, effort estimate, and dependencies ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implementation sequence defined (critical path identified) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Parallel development opportunities identified ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Milestones defined with success criteria ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Testing strategy documented ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Integration points defined (CLI tool, release workflow, GitHub) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implementation plan document complete ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- E6:S06:T02 - Package management investigation (COMPLETE)
- E6:S06:T09 - Prioritization review (COMPLETE)
- E6:S06:T03 - Feedback mechanism design (TODO - not blocking for core implementation plan)

**Blocks:**
- Package management implementation execution (Phase 3.1-3.3)
- CLI tool package backend implementation (Phase 3.3.2)

**Parallel Development Candidacy:** 
- Can proceed in parallel with T03 (feedback mechanism design)
- Blocks package management implementation work
