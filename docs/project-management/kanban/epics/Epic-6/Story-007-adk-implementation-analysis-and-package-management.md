## Overview

**Problem Statement:**

Multiple projects have implemented ai-dev-kit (ADK) frameworks at various versions, revealing critical issues:

1. **Implementation Confusion:** Projects lack clear implementation instructions, leading to mashups of:
   - ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure (from the dev-kit repo itself)
   - Kanban template from the Kanban package
   - Result: Projects have inappropriate epics (e.g., "Book Related Work" epic in non-book projects)

2. **Framework Drift:** Since ADK frameworks are works-in-progress with inherent flaws and brittleness:
   - Client projects have tuned/customized frameworks to work around issues
   - Each customization creates drift from source
   - Same framework has diverged differently across multiple projects
   - Continued development increases divergence

3. **No Package Management:** Current installation is ad-hoc (Git submodules, manual copy-paste):
   - No single package file
   - No hash verification for security
   - No proper version management
   - No update mechanism

4. **No Feedback Loop:** Pre-release projects have no structured way to provide feedback on:
   - Installation experience
   - Post-installation state
   - Framework usability
   - Issues encountered

**Solution:**

1. **Halt development** in all other projects and conduct comprehensive analysis
2. **Analyze all projects** for ADK implementation patterns (good and bad)
3. **Investigate proper package management** (single package file, hash verification)
4. **Design feedback mechanism** for pre-release projects
5. **Implement package management** based on findings
6. **Use findings to harden ADK** before continued development

---

## Goal

**Primary Goal:**
Conduct comprehensive analysis of all projects that have implemented ADK frameworks, identify implementation issues and patterns, investigate proper package management, and design feedback mechanisms to inform ADK hardening before continued development.

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ All projects with ADK implementations analyzed
- ✅ Implementation issues cataloged (mashups, drift, misuse)
- ✅ Good and bad patterns identified and documented
- ⏳ Package management solution designed (single package file, hash verification) - T02-T05 TODO
- ⏳ Pre-release feedback mechanism designed and implemented - T02-T05 TODO
- ✅ Findings synthesized into ADK hardening plan (T06 complete)
- ✅ Framework hardening implemented (T07 complete: Epic 9 fix, installer validation, source frameworks, installation docs)

- Task-level Kanban structure analysis (`docs/Analysis/task-level-kanban-structure-analysis.md`)
- Knowledge/documentation structure analysis (`docs/Analysis/knowledge-documentation-structure-analysis.md`)
- Workflow structure analysis (`docs/Analysis/workflow-structure-analysis.md`)
- Cursorrules structure analysis (`docs/Analysis/cursorrules-structure-analysis.md`)
- ADK canonical structures (current frameworks)

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive meta-analysis report with:

- Pattern frequency tables across all projects
- Convergence/divergence maps (what projects converge on vs diverge from)
- "Canonical vs legacy" matrices (ADK canonical vs real-world patterns)
- Kanban structure meta-analysis (synthesis of task-level analysis)
- Documentation/Knowledge structure meta-analysis (synthesis of KB analysis)
- Workflows meta-analysis (synthesis of workflow analysis)

**Approach:**

1. **Pattern Frequency Analysis:**

   - Extract all patterns from granular analyses
   - Count frequency of each pattern across projects
   - Create frequency tables:
     - Kanban naming patterns (E/S/T formats, padding, context)
     - KB directory naming (`docs/` vs `knowledge/` vs `docs/`)
     - Workflow step counts (10-step, 11-step, 12-step, etc.)
     - Cursorrules section organization patterns
     - Version schema patterns
     - Branch mapping patterns
   - Identify most common patterns (convergence)
   - Identify rare patterns (divergence)

2. **Convergence/Divergence Maps:**

   - **Convergence Analysis:** What patterns do projects converge on?
     - Common naming conventions

     - Compare canonical 12-step RW to 10-step, 11-step, 13-step patterns
     - Identify required vs optional steps
     - Identify customization patterns

- Current ai-dev-kit source structure

**Deliverable:** Implementation of critical and high-priority hardening recommendations:

- **CRITICAL:** Epic 9 mismatch fixed (renamed to Epic 24+)
- **CRITICAL:** Installer validation added (prevents Epic mashup)
- **HIGH:** Source repository frameworks added (`.cursorrules`, `rw-config.yaml`)
- **HIGH:** Installation instructions improved (Epic mashup prevention)

**Approach:**

1. **Fix Epic 9 Mismatch (CRITICAL):**
   - Rename Epic 9 "Book Related Work" to Epic 24+ (project-specific range)

     - Task documents: Update all Task references
     - Kanban board: Update Epic 9 entry
     - Cross-references in documentation
   - Document Epic 24+ as project-specific range (not canonical)
   - Update installation instructions to clarify project-specific epics start at Epic 24+

2. **Add Installer Validation (CRITICAL):**
   - Add Epic numbering validation to installer scripts:
     - Check for Epic 9 "Book Related Work" in non-book projects
     - Validate Epic 1-23 are canonical, Epic 24+ are project-specific
     - Warn if copying ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban
     - Prevent installation if Epic conflicts detected
   - Add validation for canonical vs project-specific epic conflicts
   - Add validation for version file path
   - Add validation for KB structure

3. **Add Source Repository Frameworks (HIGH):**
   - Create `.cursorrules` file in project root:
     - Include comprehensive 12-step RW trigger section
     - Include PVW trigger section (optional)
     - Include document lifecycle management section
     - Include Git workflow restrictions section
     - Serve as reference implementation
   - Create `rw-config.yaml` in project root:
     - Configure for ai-dev-kit project structure
     - Use canonical paths
     - Serve as reference implementation
   - Migrate version file path:
     - Move `src/fynd_deals/version.py` to `src/ai_dev_kit/version.py`
     - Update all references
     - Update workflows and scripts

4. **Improve Installation Instructions (HIGH):**

   - Clearly distinguish between templates and actual Kanban:
     - Document canonical templates location
     - Document ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban location
     - Explain difference clearly
     - Warn against copying actual Kanban
   - Document Epic mashup prevention:
     - Explain Epic mashup issue
     - Document prevention steps
     - Provide examples of correct installation
     - Provide examples of incorrect installation (what to avoid)
   - Provide clear installation examples:
     - Step-by-step installation guide
     - Example projects (tiny, small, ambitious)
     - Common mistakes and how to avoid them
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Epic 9 in ai-dev-kit source renamed to Epic 24+
- [ ] All Epic 9 references updated
- [ ] No Epic 9 "Book Related Work" in source
- [ ] Installer validates Epic numbering
- [ ] Installer prevents Epic mashup
