# Epic 6, Story 6, Task 11: Changelog Management and Archival Workflow

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-21 (v0.6.6.11+4 – Phase 6 complete: Initial archival, ALL PHASES COMPLETE)  
**Started:** 2025-12-21  
**Completed:** 2025-12-21  
**Version:** v0.6.6.11+4

**Feature Request:** [FR-025](../fr-br/FR-025-changelog-management-and-archival-workflow.md)  
**Code:** E6S06T11

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`

**Full Task ID:** `E6:S06:T11`

---

## Scope

Implement a comprehensive changelog management and archival workflow to maintain a sustainable, well-organized changelog as the project grows. This task addresses the critical problem of an unmanageable changelog (~9,500 lines) that violates best practices and creates maintenance burden.

**Problem Statement:**
- Current `CHANGELOG.md` has grown to approximately **9,500 lines**
- **Unsustainable** for manual maintenance
- **Difficult to navigate** for users and developers
- **Prone to ordering violations** and duplicate entries
- **Time-consuming** to validate and maintain
- **Inefficient** for finding recent changes vs. historical changes

**Solution:**
Implement automated changelog management workflow (CMW) with:
- Automated validation, duplicate detection, and ordering fixes
- Archival policy (size-based, time-based, or hybrid)
- Integration with Release Workflow (RW)
- Comprehensive SOPs and documentation

---

## Input

- **Feature Request:** [`FR-025-changelog-management-and-archival-workflow.md`](../../fr-br/FR-025-changelog-management-and-archival-workflow.md)
  - Comprehensive problem statement
  - Industry research on best practices and SOPs
  - Proposed solution architecture
  - Acceptance criteria
- **Current Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` (~9,500 lines)
- **Changelog Archive Directory:** `docs/changelog-and-release-notes/changelog-archive/`
- **Existing Validators:**
  - `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_changelog_format.py`
- **Reference Workflow:** Update Kanban Workflow (UKW) - Similar workflow pattern
- **Release Workflow:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/release-workflow.yaml`

---

## Deliverable

**Changelog Management and Archival System:**

1. **Changelog Management Workflow (CMW):**
   - Workflow definition: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/changelog-management-workflow.yaml`
   - **Type:** Deterministic (rule-based, script-driven)
   - **Triggers:**
     - Scheduled execution via cron (recommended - **weekly** by default, can be adjusted to biweekly or daily if needed)
     - RW Step 9.5 (automatic when threshold exceeded)
     - Manual: "CMW" or "cmw" command (for testing/debugging)
   - **Execution:** Script-based (no agent execution guide needed - deterministic operations)
   - Cursor rules trigger section: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-cmw-trigger-section.md` (optional, for manual trigger)

2. **CMW Functionality:**
   - Analyze current changelog state (size, ordering, duplicates)
   - Validate changelog format and ordering
   - Detect and report duplicates
   - Identify entries eligible for archival (based on archival policy)
   - Archive old entries to archive file
   - Validate remaining changelog entries
   - Stage and commit changes
   - Report summary of maintenance actions

3. **Archival Policy:**
   - Policy document: `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/changelog-archival-policy.md`
  - Define archival criteria:
    - **Size-based:** Archive when `CHANGELOG.md` exceeds N lines (e.g., 1000 lines)
    - **Time-based:** Archive entries older than X months (e.g., 2 months)
    - **Version-based:** Keep only last N major versions in main changelog (e.g., last 50 releases)
    - **Hybrid:** Combination of criteria (e.g., archive entries older than 2 months OR when main changelog exceeds 1000 lines)
   - Archive structure:
     - Main changelog: `CHANGELOG.md` (recent entries, manageable size)
     - Archive: `docs/changelog-and-release-notes/changelog-archive/CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md` (historical entries)
     - Detailed changelogs: Individual files remain in `docs/changelog-and-release-notes/changelog-archive/CHANGELOG_v{version}.md`

4. **RW Integration:**
   - Enhance RW Step 9 to include changelog size check
   - Add RW Step 9.5: Run CMW if changelog size exceeds threshold
   - Pre-commit validation: Validate changelog format, ordering, duplicates before commit
   - Update RW workflow definition and documentation

5. **SOPs and Documentation:**
   - Changelog management policy: `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/changelog-management-policy.md`
   - Changelog archival policy: `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/changelog-archival-policy.md`
   - CMW script documentation: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/changelog/README.md` (deterministic scripts, no agent execution guide needed)
   - CMW workflow definition: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/changelog-management-workflow.yaml`
   - Training materials (if needed)

6. **Initial Archival:**
   - Run CMW to archive old entries from current 9,500-line changelog
   - Reduce main changelog to manageable size (~500-1000 lines)
   - Preserve all historical entries in archive with full context

## Approach

### Phase 1: Define Archival Policy
1. Research and document archival criteria options
2. Select appropriate criteria (size-based, time-based, or hybrid)
3. Create archival policy document
4. Define archive structure and format

### Phase 2: Design CMW Workflow
1. Design CMW as **deterministic workflow** (unlike UKW - no agentic intelligence required)
2. Design CMW workflow steps (deterministic/script-based):
   - Step 1: Analyze changelog state
   - Step 2: Validate format and ordering
   - Step 3: Detect duplicates
   - Step 4: Identify entries for archival
   - Step 5: Archive entries
   - Step 6: Validate remaining changelog
   - Step 7: Stage and commit changes
   - Step 8: Report summary
3. Create workflow YAML definition (deterministic/script-based)
4. Create CMW orchestration script (Python script, no agent execution guide needed)
5. Create cursor rules trigger section (optional, for manual trigger)
6. Configure cron automation (scheduled execution)

### Phase 3: Implement CMW Scripts
1. Create CMW analysis script (detect size, ordering, duplicates)
2. Create archival script (move entries to archive)
3. Create validation script (validate format, ordering, duplicates)
4. Create main CMW orchestration script
5. Test scripts with current changelog

### Phase 4: Integrate with RW
1. Enhance RW Step 9 to check changelog size
2. Add RW Step 9.5: Trigger CMW if threshold exceeded
3. Add pre-commit validation hook
4. Update RW workflow definition
5. Update RW documentation

### Phase 5: Create Documentation
1. Create changelog management policy document
2. Create changelog archival policy document
3. Create CMW execution guide
4. Create training materials (if needed)
5. Update framework README with CMW references

### Phase 6: Initial Archival
1. Run CMW to archive current 9,500-line changelog
2. Verify archive contains all historical entries
3. Verify main changelog is manageable size
4. Test archive accessibility and searchability

## Notes

**Current State:**
- `CHANGELOG.md`: ~9,500 lines (unsustainable)
- Manual maintenance required for ordering and duplicates
- No archival process in place
- No defined archival policy
- Validators exist but don't prevent issues before commit

- Document Management: [receiptmake.com](https://receiptmake.com/blog/best-practices-for-document-management), [zemith.com](https://www.zemith.com/blogs/document-management-best-practices)

**Priority Justification:**
- **HIGH Priority** because current changelog is unmanageable and will only get worse
- Manual fixes are time-consuming and error-prone
- Violates best practices for changelog management
- Blocks efficient development workflow

**Implementation Considerations:**
- **CMW is deterministic** - unlike UKW, no agentic intelligence required (all operations are rule-based)
- CMW should be script-driven and suitable for cron automation
- Archival should preserve full context and maintain searchability
- Integration with RW should be seamless and non-blocking
- Policy should be configurable per project (via rw-config.yaml)
- **Cron automation recommended** - scheduled execution ensures consistent maintenance without manual intervention
