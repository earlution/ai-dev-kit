# Epic 6, Story 7, Task 111: Comprehensive install event-contract logging quality

**Task ID:** E6:S07:T111  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Estimated Effort:** Large  
**Created:** 2026-04-09  
**Code:** E6S07T111

**Implementation note:** Released **v0.6.7.111+1** (SemVer **v0.4.721+1**): CLI install JSON event contract, strict option, `ai-dev-kit logs validate-install-log`, tests/docs. Task remains **IN PROGRESS** until FR-078 acceptance criteria are verified post-release.

**Upstream:** [FR-078 - Comprehensive install event-contract logging quality](../../../fr-br/FR-078-comprehensive-install-event-contract-logging-and-feedback-quality.md)

---

## Input

- Existing install logging behavior from FR-047 (CLI + framework installer integration).
- Requirement for complete, high-fidelity local install telemetry to improve AI Dev Kit quality and release readiness.

## Deliverable

- A strict install telemetry contract and implementation where each emitted event captures `intent`, `action`, and `result`, with deterministic run/step correlation and local forensic artifacts for maintainers.

---

## Scope

1. Define canonical event schema for install telemetry (required fields + optional extensions).
2. Instrument CLI install execution and framework-specific installers to emit full step/sub-step events.
3. Capture decision intent and branch rationale (mode/backend/fallback/skip).
4. Normalize result payloads (status, duration, exit code, validation outcomes, error classes).
5. Generate deterministic local run artifacts suitable for downstream analysis and triage.
6. Add tests and validation checks for schema completeness, linkage integrity, and redaction guarantees.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** Every install step and sub-step is reconstructable as `intent -> action -> result`.
- [ ] **AC2:** Correlation fields (`install_run_id`, `step_id`, parent/child linkage) allow deterministic timeline reconstruction.
- [ ] **AC3:** Missing mandatory event fields are caught by automated validation/tests.
- [ ] **AC4:** Result payloads include normalized status, timing, exit, and validation details.
- [ ] **AC5:** Local run artifacts contain quality signals sufficient for maintainers to analyze and reproduce install behavior.
- [ ] **AC6:** Redaction tests pass and confirm no secrets are emitted.
