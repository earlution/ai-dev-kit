# Epic 6, Story 7, Task 107: IDE Command Whitelist Optimization

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Created:** 2026-03-07  
**Started:** N/A  
**Completed:** N/A  
**Version:** v0.6.7.107+1

**Task Type:** Enhancement  
**Code:** E6S07T107

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`
**Value:** `E6:S07:T107`

---

## Problem Statement

Users experiencing high friction with IDE command approval workflow due to:

1. **Concrete Command Storage**: Whitelist stores exact command strings with specific parameters
2. **Version Variations**: Commands with version numbers (e.g., `v0.6.7.101+33`) create unique entries
3. **Path Variations**: Different file paths create separate whitelist entries  
4. **Parameter Variations**: Slight parameter differences trigger new approval requests
5. **Repeated Approvals**: Same command patterns require re-approval for minor variations

---

## Goal

Optimize IDE command whitelist to reduce approval friction by implementing pattern-based command approval instead of concrete command storage.

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Analyze current whitelist behavior and friction points
- Create generalized command patterns for common operations
- Implement pattern-based whitelist configuration
- Document approved command patterns for team use
- Test and validate pattern-based approval workflow

### Out of Scope

- IDE-level security policy changes
- Whitelist implementation at IDE code level
- Cross-IDE compatibility (focus on current environment)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1**: Current whitelist friction points documented and analyzed
- [ ] **AC2**: Pattern-based whitelist configuration created and implemented
- [ ] **AC3**: Common command patterns (Python scripts, Git, file operations) generalized
- [ ] **AC4**: Configuration file created with documented patterns
- [ ] **AC5**: Pattern-based approval workflow tested and validated
- [ ] **AC6**: Documentation created for team whitelist management
- [ ] **AC7**: Reduction in approval requests for repeated command patterns

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis (1 hour)

1. Document current friction points and command patterns
2. Identify high-frequency command variations
3. Analyze whitelist storage mechanism

### Phase 2: Pattern Development (1-2 hours)

1. Create regex patterns for common command types:

```bash
python "packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_*.py"
```

2. Test pattern matching against historical commands
3. Refine patterns for optimal coverage

### Phase 3: Configuration Implementation (1 hour)

1. Create whitelist configuration file
2. Implement pattern-based entries
3. Document pattern usage and maintenance

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (1 hour)

1. Test pattern-based approval workflow
2. Validate coverage of common commands
3. Document any remaining friction points

---

## Command Patterns Identified

### High-Frequency Patterns

- **Python Validation Scripts**:

```bash
python "packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_*.py"
```

- **Git Operations**:

```bash
git (add|status|commit|push|tag|checkout|branch|log|diff|restore|show)
```

- **File Search Operations**:

```bash
find /Users/rms/Documents/projects/ai-dev-kit [options]
```

- **File Operations**:

```bash
read_file, edit, multi_edit, list_dir, find_by_name
```

---

## Deliverables

1. **Analysis Report**: Current whitelist friction documentation
2. **Configuration File**: `.cursor/whitelist-patterns.yaml`
3. **Pattern Documentation**: Team guide for whitelist management
4. **Test Results**: Validation of pattern-based approval workflow

---

## Dependencies

- None (self-contained optimization task)

---

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Pattern too broad | Medium | Start with specific patterns, gradually broaden |
| IDE doesn't support patterns | High | Document alternative approaches |
| Security concerns | Medium | Review patterns for safety implications |

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: Reduce approval requests by 80% for common command patterns
- **Secondary**: Zero repeated approvals for slight command variations
- **Tertiary**: Team adoption of pattern-based whitelist management

---

## Notes

- This task addresses developer experience friction in workflow automation
- Pattern-based approach should scale with project complexity
- Configuration should be version controlled for team consistency
- Consider creating separate patterns for different security contexts
