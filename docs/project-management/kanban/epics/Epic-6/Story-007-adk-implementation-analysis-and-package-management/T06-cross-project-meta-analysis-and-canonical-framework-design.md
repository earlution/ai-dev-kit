# Epic 6, Story 7, Task 6: Cross-project meta-analysis and canonical framework design

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-18 (v0.6.7.6+20 – All deliverables verified complete: meta-analyses, executive summary, all 4 canonical framework designs, migrated from v0.6.6.6+20)  
**Started:** 2025-12-16  
**Completed:** 2025-12-18  
**Version:** v0.6.7.6+20  
**Code:** E6S07T06

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`

**Full Task ID:** `E6:S07:T06`

---

## Scope

Conduct comprehensive cross-project meta-analysis of all ADK implementation patterns across 9 client projects plus ai-dev-kit source, synthesize findings into "ultimate" canonical framework designs for Kanban (E/S/T), Knowledge Base/documentation, Workflows, and Cursorrules. This task creates the definitive specifications that all projects should adopt, based on real-world usage patterns, convergence/divergence analysis, and good/bad practice identification.

**Problem Statement:**
Multiple projects have implemented ADK frameworks at various versions, revealing critical issues:
- Implementation confusion (mashups of ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban + template)
- Framework drift (customizations creating divergence)
- No clear canonical structure to follow
- Source repository gaps (ai-dev-kit not using own frameworks consistently)

**Solution:**
Synthesize all project analyses into definitive "ultimate" canonical framework designs that:
- Reflect real-world convergence patterns
- Support legacy patterns (backward compatibility)
- Incorporate good practices
- Avoid anti-patterns
- Provide clear adoption guidance

## Completion Summary

**Task Completed:** 2025-12-18  
**Final Version:** v0.6.7.6+20 (migrated from v0.6.6.6+20)

**What Was Delivered:**
- Comprehensive meta-analysis across 10 projects (9 client implementations + ai-dev-kit source)
- 7 meta-analysis documents synthesizing patterns, convergence/divergence, and structure-specific findings
- Good/bad practice catalog identifying what works and what doesn't
- Pattern/anti-pattern identification with root cause analysis
- Executive summary (v2.0.0) presenting proposed canonical structures and key decisions
- 4 "ultimate" canonical framework designs:
  - Workflow structure (v1.1.0) - 7 canonical workflows documented
  - Kanban structure (v2.0.0) - Complete E/S/T inventory with 10 core epics
  - KB structure (v1.0.0) - 5-pillar canonical structure
  - Cursorrules structure (v1.0.0) - Complete `.cursorrules` specification


**Key Findings:**
- Epic 9 mismatch in ai-dev-kit source identified as root cause of Epic mashup (30% of projects)
- Perfect convergence on KB directory naming (100% use `docs/`)
- Strong convergence on task naming (60% use full-context format)
- Source repository gaps identified (missing cursorrules, legacy version path)

**Critical Recommendations:**
1. Fix Epic 9 mismatch in ai-dev-kit source (rename "Book Related Work" to Epic 24+)
2. Address source repository gaps (add cursorrules, update version path)
3. Adopt proposed canonical structures across all framework dimensions
4. Implement installer validation to prevent Epic mashup

**Lessons Learned:**
- Comprehensive analysis reveals both good practices to adopt and critical issues to fix
- Source repository must "dogfood" its own frameworks consistently
- Clear separation needed between canonical templates and project-specific implementations
- Convergence analysis provides strong guidance for canonicalization decisions

**Metrics Achieved:**
- 10 projects analyzed
- 7 meta-analysis documents created
- 4 canonical framework designs delivered
- 100% of deliverables complete
