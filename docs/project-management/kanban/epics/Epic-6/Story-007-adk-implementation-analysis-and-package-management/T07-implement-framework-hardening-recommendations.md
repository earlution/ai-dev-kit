# Epic 6, Story 7, Task 7: Implement Framework Hardening Recommendations

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-18 (v0.6.7.7+6 – UKW: Task marked complete, kanban docs synchronized, migrated from v0.6.6.7+6)  
**Started:** 2025-12-18  
**Completed:** 2025-12-18  
**Version:** v0.6.7.7+6

**Progress:** Phase 1 ✅, Phase 2 ✅, Phase 3 ✅ (rw-config.yaml ✅, .cursorrules ✅), Phase 4 ✅, Acceptance criteria ✅ - ALL PHASES COMPLETE  
**Code:** E6S07T07

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`

**Full Task ID:** `E6:S07:T07`

---

## Scope

Implement the critical and high-priority framework hardening recommendations identified in E6:S07:T01's comprehensive ADK implementation analysis. This task addresses the root causes of Epic mashup (affecting 30% of client projects), framework drift, and source repository gaps that prevent ai-dev-kit from serving as a proper reference implementation.

**Problem Statement:**
- **CRITICAL:** Epic 9 mismatch in ai-dev-kit source ("Book Related Work" vs canonical "User Management and Authentication") is root cause of Epic mashup
- **CRITICAL:** No installer validation to prevent Epic mashup during installation
- **HIGH:** Source repository missing `.cursorrules` and `rw-config.yaml`, preventing it from demonstrating own frameworks
- **HIGH:** Installation instructions unclear, leading to confusion between templates and actual Kanban

**Solution:**
Implement all critical and high-priority hardening actions:
1. Fix Epic 9 mismatch (rename to Epic 24+, update all references)
2. Add installer validation (prevent Epic mashup, validate Epic numbering)
3. Add source repository frameworks (`.cursorrules`, `rw-config.yaml`, canonical version path)
4. Improve installation instructions (clear template vs actual Kanban distinction, Epic mashup prevention)

---

## Notes

**Critical Priority:**
This task addresses the root cause of Epic mashup affecting 30% of client projects. The Epic 9 mismatch must be fixed immediately to prevent further issues.

**Implementation Order:**
1. Fix Epic 9 mismatch first (removes root cause)
2. Add installer validation (prevents future issues)
3. Add source frameworks (enables reference implementation)
4. Improve installation instructions (prevents user confusion)

**Testing:**
- Test Epic 9 rename (verify all references updated)
- Test installer validation (verify Epic mashup prevention)
- Test source frameworks (verify `.cursorrules` and `rw-config.yaml` work)
- Test installation instructions (verify clarity and completeness)
