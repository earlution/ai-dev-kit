# E6:S07:T105 – Release Runbook Creation

**Task ID:** E6:S07:T105
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Created:** 2026-03-07
**Last updated:** 2026-03-10 (Release Runbook Creation COMPLETE - Comprehensive runbook with exact commands created)

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Runbook Location:** `docs/maintenance/release-runbook.md`
**Supplementary Materials:** Quick reference, checklists, configuration examples, integration guides

---

## Scope

Create a comprehensive release runbook that documents the exact commands and order for executing releases, respecting the "no manual commit/push" policy and supporting both registry and task-touch SemVer tagging modes.

---

## Inputs

- FR-046: RW Uses SemVer Tag When Task-Touch Enabled implementation
- RW execution documentation and cursorrules
- Release automation audit findings (from T104)
- Current release procedures and best practices
- "No manual commit/push" policy requirements

---

## Deliverable

### Primary Runbook Document
**Location**: `docs/maintenance/release-runbook.md`

#### Runbook Sections
1. **Pre-Release Checklist**
   - Branch safety validation
   - Configuration verification
   - Dependencies check
   - Environment validation

2. **Release Execution Commands**
   - Exact command sequences for both tagging modes
   - Step-by-step instructions with expected outputs
   - Error handling and recovery procedures
   - Rollback procedures if needed

3. **Tagging Strategy Guide**
   - Registry mode commands and examples
   - Task-touch mode commands and examples
   - Configuration switching procedures
   - Tag verification and validation

4. **Post-Release Verification**
   - Tag creation verification
   - GitHub release validation
   - Package publishing confirmation
   - Documentation updates verification

5. **Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Tag collision resolution
   - Permission problems
   - Network/CI issues

### Supplementary Materials
- **Quick Reference Cards**: One-page command summaries
- **Checklist Templates**: Printable pre/post release checklists
- **Configuration Examples**: Sample rw-config.yaml files
- **Integration Guides**: GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipeline integration

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Complete runbook with exact commands for both tagging modes
- [x] Step-by-step instructions respecting "no manual commit/push" policy
- [x] Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- [x] Quick reference materials for common scenarios
- [x] Integration examples for CI/CD pipelines
- [x] Validation procedures for release verification
- [x] Test the runbook with actual release scenarios

## Implementation Results

### ✅ Primary Runbook Document
**Location:** `docs/maintenance/release-runbook.md`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Features Implemented:**
- **Pre-Release Checklist:** Branch safety, configuration verification, dependencies check
- **Release Execution Commands:** Exact command sequences for both registry and task-touch modes
- **Tagging Strategy Guide:** Complete procedures for both modes with configuration switching
- **Post-Release Verification:** Tag validation, GitHub release confirmation, documentation updates
- **Troubleshooting Guide:** Common issues, tag collisions, permission problems, network issues

### ✅ Supplementary Materials Created

#### Quick Reference Cards
**Location:** `docs/maintenance/release-quick-reference.md`
**Content:** One-page command summaries for both modes

#### Checklist Templates
**Location:** `docs/maintenance/release-checklist-templates.md`
**Content:** Printable pre/post release checkboxes with validation steps

#### Configuration Examples
**Location:** `docs/maintenance/release-configuration-examples.md`
**Content:** Sample rw-config.yaml files for different scenarios

#### Integration Guides
**Location:** `docs/maintenance/release-integration-guides.md`
**Content:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Docker integration examples

### ✅ Policy Compliance
- **"No Manual Commit/Push" Policy:** Fully respected throughout

- **Security Considerations:** Included in integration guides

### ✅ Dual Strategy Support
- **Registry Mode:** Traditional internal version tags (v0.5.1.48+1)
- **Task-Touch Mode:** SemVer tags (v0.5.39+1) with optional internal tags
- **Configuration Switching:** Clear procedures for changing between modes

### ✅ Documentation Integration
- **Maintenance README:** Updated to reference new runbook
- **Cross-References:** Links to related documentation
- **Version References:** Consistent with existing documentation

---

## Dependencies

- FR-046 implementation (RW SemVer tagging)
- T104: Release Automation Audit (findings and recommendations)
- Current release procedures documentation

---

## Related Work

- E6:S07:T103: RW Maintenance (perpetual task)
- E6:S07:T104: Release Automation Audit
- FR-046: RW Uses SemVer Tag When Task-Touch Enabled
- Release workflow documentation

## Notes

This runbook is critical because:

1. **Policy Compliance**: Must respect "no manual commit/push" policy
2. **Dual Strategy Support**: Must cover both registry and task-touch modes
3. **Operational Excellence**: Reduces release errors and improves consistency
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Enables team members to perform releases reliably

The runbook should be:
- **Actionable**: Exact commands, not vague descriptions
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all release scenarios and edge cases
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update as processes evolve
- **Tested**: Validated with actual release procedures

Priority is HIGH because releases are critical operations and the new task-touch tagging introduces complexity that needs clear documentation.
