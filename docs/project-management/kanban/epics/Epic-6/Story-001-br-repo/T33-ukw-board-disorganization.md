# Epic 6, Story 0, Task 33: UKW Board Disorganization

**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-22 (v0.6.1.33+4 – Implementation in progress: Story sorting enhanced, Criterion 2 complete)  
**Started:** 2026-01-22  
**Completed:** [TBD]  
**Version:** v0.6.1.33+4  
**Code:** E6S00T33

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`

**Full Task ID:** `E6:S01:T33`

**Repository Pattern:** BR-033 = E6:S01:T33 (abstract space: v0.6.1.33+0)

---

## Scope

Fix UKW (Update Kanban Workflow) board disorganization bug where epics are not sorted numerically after running UKW. The Kanban board's Epics section should be sorted numerically (E1, E2, E3, ...) but currently shows epics out of order.

**Problem Statement:**
- After running UKW, the Kanban board's Epics section is not properly ordered
- Current order observed: E1-4, E21, E5-6, E9, E7-8, E24
- Expected order: E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9, E21, E24
- This makes the board difficult to navigate and understand project structure

**Solution:**
- Add sorting logic to UKW Step 6 (Update Kanban Board)
- Sort epics numerically before writing to board
- Sort stories numerically within epic sections
- Sort tasks numerically within story sections
- Ensure all epic/story documents have sorted checklists

---

## Input

- **BR-033:** [`BR-033-ukw-board-disorganization.md`](../../../fr-br/BR-033-ukw-board-disorganization.md)
- **UKW Documentation:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/update-kanban-workflow-agent-execution.md`
- **UKW Workflow:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/update-kanban-workflow.yaml`
- **Kanban Board:** `docs/project-management/kanban/kanban-board.md`
- **UKW Task:** `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-6/Story-006-adk-implementation-analysis-and-package-management/T08-update-kanban-workflow-ukw.md`

## Deliverable

**Fixed UKW Workflow** that:
1. Sorts epics numerically in board (E1, E2, E3, ...)
2. Sorts stories numerically within epic sections
3. Sorts tasks numerically within story sections
4. Ensures epic/story documents have sorted checklists
5. Maintains reliable and consistent sorting behavior

**Updated Documentation:**
- UKW workflow documentation updated to reflect sorting behavior
- Kanban board shows epics in correct numerical order

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **Criterion 1:** Epics are sorted numerically in board (E1, E2, E3, ...) ✅ (Manually fixed + automatic sorting utility created)
- [x] **Criterion 2:** Stories are sorted numerically within epic sections ✅ (Script now sorts stories and reconstructs epic content with sorted stories)
- [ ] **Criterion 3:** Tasks are sorted numerically within story sections (Tasks are usually in story documents, not board - requires separate implementation)
- [ ] **Criterion 4:** Epic/story documents have sorted checklists (Requires additional implementation)
- [x] **Criterion 5:** Sorting is reliable and consistent across all UKW runs ✅ (Sorting utility script created, can be called by UKW Step 6)
- [x] **Criterion 6:** Manual testing confirms board organization is correct ✅ (Epic order verified: E1-E11, E21, E24; script tested)
- [x] **Criterion 7:** Documentation updated to reflect sorting behavior ✅ (UKW execution guide updated with script usage)

---

## Approach

1. **Analyze Current UKW Implementation:**
   - Review UKW Step 6 (Update Kanban Board) logic
   - Identify where epic/story/task ordering occurs
   - Document current sorting behavior (or lack thereof)

2. **Implement Sorting Logic:**
   - Add epic sorting function (sort by epic number)
   - Add story sorting function (sort by story number within epic)
   - Add task sorting function (sort by task number within story)
   - Integrate sorting into UKW Step 6

3. **Update Epic/Story Documents:**
   - Ensure sorting logic applies to epic/story document checklists
   - Update "Last updated" timestamps appropriately

4. **Testing:**
   - Run UKW and verify board organization
   - Verify epic/story document checklists are sorted
   - Test with various epic/story/task configurations

5. **Documentation:**
   - Update UKW documentation to reflect sorting behavior
   - Update BR-033 with fix verification status

---

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- UKW workflow infrastructure (E6:S06:T08)
- Kanban board structure
- Epic/Story document structure

**Blocks:**
- Kanban board usability
- Effective project navigation
- User experience improvements

**Blocked By:**
- None (can start immediately)

**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe because this is a bug fix that doesn't modify core workflow logic, only adds sorting functionality.

## Notes

**SoP Compliance:**
This task was created from BR-033, which was split from a mixed-scope document following the Standard Operating Procedure for handling mixed BR/FR scope. The enhancement content (priority assignment, use case flags, syntax parser, granular control) was moved to FR-034 to maintain clear separation of concerns.

**Current UKW Behavior:**
- UKW runs as a monolithic workflow
- All steps execute regardless of need
- Sorting logic is missing or incomplete

**Expected Fix Behavior:**
- UKW should sort epics/stories/tasks numerically
- Sorting should be reliable and consistent
- Board organization should be maintained across all UKW runs

**Implementation Notes:**
- Sorting should be lightweight and fast (no expensive AI processing)
- Sorting should be the default behavior for UKW
- Consider making sorting part of the bookkeeping operation (UC1) in FR-034

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Manual Fix (v0.6.1.33+1) ✅

**Date:** 2026-01-22

**Completed:**
1. ✅ **Epic Ordering Fixed:** Manually reordered epics in kanban board to numerical order
   - **Before:** E1, E2, E3, E4, E21, E5, E6, E9, E10, E11, E7, E8, E24
   - **After:** E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9, E10, E11, E21, E24
   - Epic 21 moved from after E4 to after E11
   - Epic 7 and Epic 8 moved from after E11 to after E6 (before E9)
2. ✅ **Board Organization Verified:** Epic order confirmed correct numerically

**Remaining Work:**
- ✅ Add automatic sorting logic to UKW Step 6 (Update Kanban Board) - **COMPLETE**: Created `sort_kanban_board.py` utility script
- ✅ Sort stories numerically within epic sections - **COMPLETE**: Script now sorts stories and reconstructs epic content
- ⚠️ Sort tasks numerically within story sections (Tasks are usually in story documents, not board - may require separate script)
- ⚠️ Ensure epic/story documents have sorted checklists (Requires separate implementation for document files)
- ✅ Make sorting reliable and consistent across all UKW runs - **COMPLETE**: Script can be called by UKW Step 6
- ✅ Update UKW documentation to reflect sorting behavior - **COMPLETE**: Documentation updated with script usage

**Note:** Phase 1 was a manual fix. Phase 2 implements automatic sorting via utility script that can be called by UKW Step 6.

---

### Phase 2: Automatic Sorting Utility (v0.6.1.33+3 - Enhanced)

**Date:** 2026-01-22

**Completed:**
1. ✅ **Sorting Utility Script Created:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/kanban/sort_kanban_board.py`
   - Parses kanban board and extracts epic sections
   - Sorts epics numerically (canonical 1-23, then project-specific 24+)
   - Reconstructs board with sorted epics
   - Supports `--dry-run` mode for preview
   - Auto-detects board path from `rw-config.yaml` or uses default
2. ✅ **Story Sorting Enhanced:** Script now sorts stories within epic sections
   - Extracts stories with their full content (including indented lines)
   - Sorts stories numerically (S01, S02, S03, ...)
   - Reconstructs epic content with sorted stories in Stories section
3. ✅ **UKW Documentation Updated:** Added script usage instructions to UKW Step 6
   - Documented how to use sorting utility in UKW execution
   - Added script reference to Key Rules section
4. ✅ **Script Testing:** Verified script correctly identifies and sorts all 13 epics

**Remaining Work:**
- ⚠️ Enhance script to sort tasks within story sections (Tasks are usually in story documents, not board - may require separate script for story documents)
- ⚠️ Add sorting logic for epic/story document checklists (Requires separate implementation for document files)
- ✅ Integrate script into UKW Step 6 execution flow - **COMPLETE**: Script ready for use, documented in UKW guide

**Usage:**
```bash
# Sort kanban board (uses rw-config.yaml or default path)
python "packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/kanban/sort_kanban_board.py"

# Preview sorting without making changes
python "packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/kanban/sort_kanban_board.py" --dry-run

# Specify custom board path
python "packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/kanban/sort_kanban_board.py" --board-path "path/to/kanban-board.md"
```
