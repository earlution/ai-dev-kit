# Epic 6, Story 9, Task 2: Brownfield modular adopter integration (FR-081)

**Task ID:** E6:S09:T02  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium  
**Created:** 2026-04-19  
**Code:** E6S09T02

**Upstream:** [FR-081 - Brownfield modular adopter integration](../../../fr-br/FR-081-brownfield-modular-adopter-integration.md)

---

## Task ID

**Full Task ID:** `E6:S09:T02`

---

## Input

- **FR-081** scope (modular adoption, contract-first wiring).
- [ADR-003](../../../../../architecture/standards-and-adrs/ADR-003-greenfield-vs-brownfield-adoption.md) and greenfield delivery (**FR-080** / **E6:S09:T01**) for cross-links only.
- [`rw-validators-consumer-layout.md`](../../../../../../packages/frameworks/workflow%20mgt/docs/rw-validators-consumer-layout.md) and user-docs installation guides.

---

## Problem statement

[ADR-003](../../../../../architecture/standards-and-adrs/ADR-003-greenfield-vs-brownfield-adoption.md) states that brownfield projects own their architecture. Adopters need **actionable** guidance: required vs optional integration surfaces, contract-first wiring, and respect for host trees—without conflating with the greenfield happy path (FR-080 / **E6:S09:T01**).

---

## Deliverable

- **Brownfield adoption** documentation and any **targeted** installer or messaging changes required by FR-081.
- **Per-surface matrices** (required / optional / recommended) for partial adoption.
- **Tradeoff log** for decisions explicitly deferred (so context is not lost).

---

## Scope

1. Author or extend **brownfield** section(s) in `framework-dependency-installation-guide.md` and `INSTALL_IN_YOUR_PROJECT.md` (exact split per implementation).
2. Add **worked example** of partial adoption (hypothetical or anonymized).
3. Audit framework READMEs for **imposed-tree** language; align with **modular, contract-first** messaging.
4. File follow-up tasks for any large sub-efforts uncovered (do not silently expand scope without Kanban intake).

---

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** FR-081 requirements satisfied or deferred with documented rationale.
- [ ] **AC2:** Brownfield readers can determine **minimum wiring** for RW-only vs fuller stack paths.
- [ ] **AC3:** ADR-003 referenced from installation docs as policy anchor for brownfield.

---

## Dependencies / coordination

- **E6:S09:T01:** Greenfield docs must remain clearly separated from brownfield content.
