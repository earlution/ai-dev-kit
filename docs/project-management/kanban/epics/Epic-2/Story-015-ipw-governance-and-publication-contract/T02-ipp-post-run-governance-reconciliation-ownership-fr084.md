# Epic 2, Story 15, Task 2: IPP post-run governance reconciliation ownership (FR-084)

**Task ID:** E2:S15:T02  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium  
**Created:** 2026-04-20  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-20 (FR-084 intake created, story + board wiring completed; pending RW release)  
**Code:** E2S15T02

**Upstream:** [FR-084 - IPP post-run governance reconciliation ownership](../../../fr-br/FR-084-ipp-post-run-governance-reconciliation-ownership.md)

---

## Input

- [FR-084](../../../fr-br/FR-084-ipp-post-run-governance-reconciliation-ownership.md) requirements.
- Existing IPW governance baseline under Story 015.
- Current governance surfaces: host task docs, source FR/BR/UXR docs, `kboard.md`, `fbuboard.md`.

---

## Problem statement

IPW completion currently does not guarantee deterministic reconciliation of all required governance surfaces. This causes stale status, missing links, and board visibility drift after planning runs.

---

## Deliverable

- Explicit, enforceable IPP post-run reconciliation contract covering task doc, FR/BR/UXR doc, `kboard.md`, and `fbuboard.md`.
- Deterministic order and idempotency expectations for repeated IPW execution.
- Traceability wiring for FR/task/story/boards.

---

## Scope

1. Define ownership and sequence for post-run governance updates.
2. Specify idempotent behavior and duplicate-row prevention.
3. Specify warning/error behavior for ambiguous reconciliation cases.
4. Wire FR-084 and this task into active tracking surfaces.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** Contract assigns post-run ownership for host task reconciliation.
- [ ] **AC2:** Contract assigns post-run ownership for source FR/BR/UXR reconciliation.
- [ ] **AC3:** Contract assigns post-run ownership for `kboard.md` and `fbuboard.md`.
- [ ] **AC4:** Reconciliation order and idempotency expectations are documented and testable.
- [ ] **AC5:** FR-084 and E2:S15:T02 are bidirectionally linked and visible in active boards/story checklist.
