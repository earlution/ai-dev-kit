# Story 015 – IPW Governance and Publication Contract

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Created:** 2026-04-14  
**Completed:** 2026-04-27  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-27 (v0.2.15.7+1 – T07 complete: Canonical RW/UKW kanban consistency program)
**Version:** v0.2.15.7+1
**Code:** E2S15

---

## Overview

Define and harden IPW governance for planning artifact publication so durable spec/test/plan outputs are either deterministically filed into Docusaurus surfaces or explicitly marked as not applicable.

---

## Goal

Eliminate IPW documentation publication drift by making ownership, filing targets, validation behavior, and backfill expectations explicit and enforceable.
