## Overview

This story performs the RC readiness **implementation review** for the Workflow Management framework package (`packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/`). The review verifies the package implementation against documented expectations and identifies gaps before RC sign-off.

---

## Expectations Baseline (Draft)

**Core operating principles (package README):**
- Package provides complete Release Workflow (RW) trigger and agent-driven workflow execution pattern
- **Standalone usage:** Can be used independently (9/10 independence score)
- **Copy, don't reference:** Projects must copy package and customize paths/terminology
- **Agent-driven execution:** Intelligent, context-aware, not deterministic scripts
- **Epic branch workflow:** ALWAYS work on epic branches, NEVER commit directly to main

**Expected workflows:**
- **Release Workflow (RW):** 13-step release process (version bump, changelog, Git ops, Kanban updates)
- **Update Kanban Workflow (UKW):** 8-step kanban synchronization (bottom-up approach)
- **Changelog Management Workflow (CMW):** Deterministic changelog maintenance (archive, dedupe, ordering)
- **Intake Workflow:** 7-step FR/BR/UXR automation (converts to Kanban tasks)

**Integration expectations:**
- **With Versioning:** RW uses version schema (soft dependency)
- **With Kanban:** RW auto-updates Kanban docs, UKW syncs kanban (soft dependency)
- **Complete integration:** Three-way integration (Kanban ↔ Versioning ↔ RW)

**Package composition:**
- Core methodology documents (agent execution guides)
- Workflow definitions (YAML)
- Validation scripts (branch context, changelog format, version bump)
- Changelog management scripts (CMW)
- Version management scripts (SemVer conversion)
- GitHub integration scripts (release creation)
- Cursor rules sections (RW/UKW triggers)
- Configuration (rw-config.yaml schema and examples)
- Installation scripts (RW installer CLI)

**Sources:**
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/README.md`
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/`
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/`
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/config/rw-config-schema.md`

## Goal

Provide a complete implementation review, evidence, and remediation plan to support RC sign-off for the Workflow Management framework.

## Tasks

### E2:S13:T01 – Establish expectations baseline for Workflow Management package

**Task ID:** E2:S13:T01  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Scope:** Define the implementation expectations baseline for the Workflow Management framework package. Extract expected features, workflows, integration behaviors, and package composition from documentation.  
**Input:** Package README, implementation guides, workflow definitions  
**Deliverable:** Expectations baseline document for behavior and scope  
**Approach:** Extract expected features, workflows, and integration behaviors.  
**Version Anchor:** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.2.13.1+1)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Expectations baseline documented and approved ✅
- [x] Core operating principles captured ✅
- [x] Expected workflows documented ✅
- [x] Integration expectations mapped ✅
- [x] Package composition documented ✅
- [x] Sources referenced ✅

### E2:S13:T02 – Inventory package components and map to expectations

**Input:** Package directory inventory  
**Deliverable:** Component map with expected vs actual coverage  
**Approach:** Map scripts, workflows, templates, and docs to expectations.

### E2:S13:T03 – Validate workflow behavior against documented guidance

**Input:** RW/UKW documentation and workflow YAML  
**Deliverable:** Behavior validation notes and discrepancies  
**Approach:** Validate key workflow behaviors against docs and policies.

### E2:S13:T04 – Review integrations and dependency alignment

**Input:** Integration docs and dependency references  
**Deliverable:** Integration alignment report  
**Approach:** Verify integration touchpoints with Kanban and Versioning.

### E2:S13:T05 – Create gap log and risk assessment

**Input:** Findings from T01–T04  
**Deliverable:** Gap log with severity and risk notes  
**Approach:** Consolidate gaps and categorize by RC impact.

### E2:S13:T06 – Define RC sign-off criteria and remediation tasks

**Input:** Gap log and expected behaviors  
**Deliverable:** RC sign-off checklist and remediation task list  
**Approach:** Define minimum bar for RC and backlog tasks.
