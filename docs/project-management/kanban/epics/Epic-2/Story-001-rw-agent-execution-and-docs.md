### E2:S01:T04 – Update RW changelog step to require verification before marking fixes as "fixed"

**Input:** Current RW changelog documentation  
**Deliverable:** Updated RW documentation requiring verification for fixes  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Blocker:** None

**Approach:**
1. Review Step 3 (Create Detailed Changelog) and Step 4 (Update Main Changelog) in `release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
2. Update documentation to specify that fixes cannot be claimed as "Fixed" until verified through testing
3. Add requirement that unverified fixes should be logged as "Attempted fix" until verification
4. Specify verification methods: test suite execution or manual testing
5. Update changelog format guidelines to include verification status
6. Add validation step to ensure fixes are not marked as "Fixed" without verification evidence

**Problem Solved:**
- Prevents claiming fixes are complete before they're actually verified
- Ensures changelogs accurately reflect the state of fixes
- Maintains integrity of release documentation

**Files to Update:**
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/docs/documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`

### E2:S01:T05 – Harden RW branch safety checks to stop execution on wrong branch

**Input:** Current RW Step 1 implementation, `validate_branch_context.py` script  
**Deliverable:** Hardened RW with mandatory branch safety enforcement  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Blocker:** None

**Problem Statement:**
The Release Workflow (RW) currently has Step 1: Branch Safety Check documented, but it is not being enforced. The RW continues execution even when on the wrong branch (e.g., on `epic/9` but committing Epic 5 work). This allows cross-epic contamination and violates branch isolation principles. The RW must STOP immediately if branch safety checks fail and provide clear guidance to the user.

**Approach:**
1. **Audit current implementation:**
   - Review Step 1 execution in `release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
   - Review `validate_branch_context.py` script behavior
   - Identify gaps where RW continues despite branch mismatches
   - Document all failure modes where branch safety is bypassed

2. **Design mandatory branch safety enforcement:**
   - Define branch safety check as **MANDATORY BLOCKING STEP**
   - Ensure Step 1 runs BEFORE any file modifications
   - Design clear failure states and error messages
   - Create user guidance for branch mismatch scenarios

3. **Implement branch safety hardening:**
   - Update RW Step 1 to call `validate_branch_context.py` and parse exit code
   - If validator returns non-zero exit code, STOP workflow immediately
   - Mark all remaining steps as `cancelled`
   - Output clear error message with actionable guidance

4. **Update RW documentation:**
   - Update `release-workflow-agent-execution.md` Step 1 to emphasize MANDATORY nature
   - Add explicit "DO NOT PROCEED" language
   - Document exact error message format
   - Add examples of branch mismatch scenarios and resolutions

5. **Update agent guidance:**
   - Update `.cursorrules` RW trigger section to emphasize branch safety
   - Add explicit instruction: "If Step 1 fails, DO NOT proceed to Step 2"
   - Create agent rules that prevent bypassing branch checks
   - Document anti-pattern: "Never skip or ignore branch safety checks"

6. **Create validation integration:**
   - Ensure `validate_branch_context.py` returns proper exit codes
   - Integrate validator into RW Step 1 execution flow
   - Add validation result parsing and error handling
   - Create test scenarios for branch mismatch detection

**Deliverables:**
- Hardened RW Step 1 that stops on branch mismatch
- Updated `release-workflow-agent-execution.md` with mandatory enforcement
- Updated `.cursorrules` RW trigger section with branch safety emphasis
- Integration of `validate_branch_context.py` into RW execution
- Clear error messages and user guidance for branch mismatches
- Agent rules preventing branch safety bypass

**Success Criteria:**
- RW stops immediately if branch safety check fails
- No file modifications occur when on wrong branch
- Clear error messages guide user to correct branch
- All remaining steps marked as `cancelled` on failure
- Agent cannot bypass branch safety checks
- Validator integration is mandatory and non-optional

**Error Message Format:**
```
🚨 RELEASE WORKFLOW BLOCKED

Step 1: Branch Safety Check - FAILED

Reason: Current branch '{branch}' does not align with the work being released.

Details:
- Current branch: {branch}
- Expected branch: epic/{expected_epic}
- Version file shows: {version}
- Detected epic from work: {detected_epic}

Action Required:
1. Switch to the correct branch: git checkout epic/{correct_epic}
2. Verify your changes align with the branch: git status
3. Then run RW again

RW is NOT complete. Workflow stopped at Step 1.
All subsequent steps have been cancelled.
```

**Files to Update:**
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/docs/documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` (Step 1 hardening)
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md` (branch safety emphasis)
- Agent execution patterns (mandatory validation)

### E2:S01:T06 – Fix changelog validator ordering bug 🔄 REOPENED

**Input:**  
- **Bug Report:** [BR-002: Changelog Validator Ordering Bug](../../fr-br/BR-002-changelog-validator-ordering-bug.md) (REOPENED)
- Current `validate_changelog_format.py` implementation
- Validation errors from CHANGELOG.md restoration (2025-12-16)

**Deliverable:**  
- Fixed `validate_changelog_format.py` that supports both Keep a Changelog format (newest first) and canonical ordering (lowest first)
- Configuration option to select format (via config file or command-line flag)
- Updated documentation explaining both supported formats
- Test cases verifying both formats work correctly

**Dependencies:** None  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Previous Attempt (v0.2.1.6+2):**
- Task was marked complete but bug still present
- Validator still only accepts canonical ordering
- Need to review what was actually implemented and fix properly

**Problem Statement:**
The `validate_changelog_format.py` validator checks for canonical ordering (version numbers ordered from lowest to highest), but Keep a Changelog format requires entries to be ordered from newest to oldest (highest version first). This creates a conflict where correctly formatted changelogs fail validation.

**Current Validation Errors (2025-12-16):**
```
❌ VALIDATION FAILED:
  Changelog ordering violation: 0.4.6.4+1 appears before 0.4.6.3+1, but canonical ordering requires 0.4.6.3+1 before 0.4.6.4+1
  Changelog ordering violation: 0.2.11.9+3 appears before 0.2.11.9+2, but canonical ordering requires 0.2.11.9+2 before 0.2.11.9+3
  [... multiple similar violations for Keep a Changelog format ...]
```

**Approach:**
1. **Review previous implementation:**
   - Review what was actually implemented in v0.2.1.6+2
   - Understand why bug persists despite task being marked complete
   - Document findings

2. **Design format support:**
   - Support both Keep a Changelog format (newest first) and canonical ordering (lowest first)
   - Add configuration option (via `rw-config.yaml` or command-line flag)
   - Default to Keep a Changelog format (industry standard)

3. **Implement fix:**
   - Update `validate_changelog_ordering()` function to detect format
   - Add format detection logic (check if entries are newest-first or lowest-first)
   - Add configuration support for explicit format selection
   - Update error messages to indicate which format is expected

4. **Add tests:**
   - Test cases for Keep a Changelog format (newest first)
   - Test cases for canonical ordering (lowest first)
   - Test cases for format detection
   - Test cases for configuration override

5. **Update documentation:**
   - Document both supported formats
   - Explain how to configure format preference
   - Update RW documentation if needed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Validator supports both Keep a Changelog format (newest first) and canonical ordering (lowest first)
- [ ] Validator can detect format automatically or be configured explicitly
- [ ] Validator provides clear error messages indicating which format is expected
- [ ] Documentation updated to explain both supported formats
- [ ] Default behavior aligns with Keep a Changelog format (industry standard)
- [ ] Test cases verify both formats work correctly
- [ ] Fix verified with actual CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format)

**Files to Update:**
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_changelog_format.py` - Add format support
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/config/rw-config-schema.md` - Add format configuration option
- Documentation explaining both formats

**Related:**
- **Bug Report:** [BR-002: Changelog Validator Ordering Bug](../../fr-br/BR-002-changelog-validator-ordering-bug.md) (REOPENED)
- **Documentation:** 
  - [REOPENING_BR_AND_TASKS_GUIDE.md](../../fr-br/REOPENING_BR_AND_TASKS_GUIDE.md) - Guide for reopening BRs/tasks
  - [BIDIRECTIONAL_WIRING_PRINCIPLE.md](../../fr-br/BIDIRECTIONAL_WIRING_PRINCIPLE.md) - Principle for bidirectional linking (this task demonstrates the pattern)

- Previous attempt: E2:S01:T06 (v0.2.1.6+2) - marked complete but bug persists

### E2:S01:T07 – Add support for update/maintenance branch patterns in branch validation

**Input:**  
- Bug Report BR-003: RW Branch Validation Missing Support for Update/Maintenance Branches
- Current `validate_branch_context.py` implementation
- User feedback: "update/ai-dev-kit branch pattern is good for framework updates, but RW should know about it"

**Deliverable:**  
- Updated `validate_branch_context.py` with support for `update/*` branch patterns
- Configurable branch mapping via `rw-config.yaml` (optional enhancement)
- Updated RW documentation explaining update branch handling
- No warnings for valid `update/*` branches

**Dependencies:** E2:S01:T05 (branch safety hardening foundation)  
**Blocker:** None

**Problem Statement:**
The `validate_branch_context.py` script only recognizes `main` branch and `epic/\{n\}` pattern branches. When running RW on an `update/ai-dev-kit` branch (or similar update/maintenance branches), the validator issues a warning: "Branch 'update/ai-dev-kit' not in known mapping - cannot validate version". The `update/*` branch pattern is a good practice for incorporating framework updates, and the RW should recognize and support this pattern.

**Approach:**
1. **Extend branch pattern recognition:**
   - Add support for `update/*` branch pattern (e.g., `update/ai-dev-kit`, `update/workflow-mgt`)
   - Consider other maintenance patterns (e.g., `maintenance/*`, `upgrade/*`)
   - Decide on validation behavior: skip validation (like `main`) or provide configurable mapping

2. **Update `parse_branch_epic()` function:**
   - Add pattern matching for `update/*` branches
   - Return appropriate epic context (None for skip, or extract from config)
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing `epic/\{n\}` pattern

3. **Add configuration support (optional enhancement):**
   - Extend `rw-config.yaml` schema to support custom branch mappings
   - Allow projects to define their own branch patterns
   - Document configuration options

4. **Update validation logic:**
   - Handle `update/*` branches appropriately (skip validation or use config)
   - Remove warning for recognized update branches
   - Maintain clear error messages for truly unknown branches

5. **Update documentation:**
   - Document `update/*` branch pattern usage in RW guide
   - Explain when to use update branches vs epic branches
   - Add examples of update branch usage
   - Update `.cursorrules` if needed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `validate_branch_context.py` recognizes `update/*` branch patterns ✅
- [x] No warnings issued for valid `update/*` branches ✅
- [x] Update branches handled appropriately (skip validation similar to `main` branch) ✅
- [ ] Documentation updated to explain update branch handling (pending)
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained with existing `epic/\{n\}` pattern ✅
- [ ] Optional: Configuration support for custom branch patterns (future enhancement)

**Files to Update:**
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_branch_context.py` - Add update branch support
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/docs/documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` - Document update branch usage
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/config/rw-config-schema.md` - Add branch mapping configuration (if implementing config support)
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md` - Update branch mapping section (if needed)

**Related:**
- BR-003: RW Branch Validation Missing Support for Update/Maintenance Branches
- E2:S01:T05: Harden RW branch safety checks (foundation for branch validation)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] RW documentation is fully portable and template-ready ✅
- [x] Examples are clearly tagged as dev-kit vs external ✅
- [x] Changelog step requires verification before marking fixes as "Fixed" ✅
- [x] Unverified fixes are logged as "Attempted fix" until verified ✅
