# Task E2:S01:T13 - RW -k forensic task attribution alignment (BR-063)

**Task ID:** E2:S01:T13  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Created:** 2026-04-07  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-07 (intake + forensic release-record cleanup completed)  
**Version:** v0.2.1.13+1  
**Code:** E2S01T13

---

## Summary

Enforce forensic task attribution consistency for `RW -k` so requested task ids and release version anchors cannot diverge silently.

---

## Input

- [BR-063](../../../fr-br/BR-063-rw-k-task-attribution-drift-between-requested-task-and-version-anchor.md)
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_rw_task_intent.py`
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_version_bump.py`
- RW execution docs and runbook semantics for `RW -k`

---

## Deliverable

1. File and wire BR-063 + housed Story 1 task for attribution-drift remediation.
2. Clean existing forensic mismatch for `v0.2.1.10+6` so release artifacts use one canonical task anchor.
3. Reflect corrected attribution in main/detailed changelogs and kanban-linked docs.
4. Preserve follow-on implementation path for validator/runtime hardening.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] BR-063 filed with clear reproduction, impact, and proposed solution.
- [x] Task housed under E2:S01 and bidirectionally linked.
- [x] Existing `v0.2.1.10+6` release records corrected to canonical task anchor (`T10`).
- [x] Board/story references updated to reflect current forensic state.
