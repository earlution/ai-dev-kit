# Story 007 – Trigger-Aware Release Workflow

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Created:** 2025-12-10  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-10 (v0.2.7.6+1 – All tasks complete: Design, trigger registry, workflow executor, deliverable processor, trigger integration, agentic task workflow integration, workflow orchestrator, documentation and testing implemented)  
**Version:** v0.2.7.6+1  
**Code:** E2S07

---

## Overview

Implement a trigger-aware Release Workflow (RW) system that can react to specified triggers, dynamically run sub-workflows, and intelligently process deliverables. This includes implementing the FR/BR/UXR commit trigger that automatically triggers the agentic Kanban task creation workflow.

---

## Goal

Create a trigger-aware RW system that:
- Detects specified trigger conditions
- Dynamically executes sub-workflows based on triggers
- Intelligently processes deliverables from sub-workflows
- Chains workflows together for complex use cases
- Provides explanations for workflow decisions
