# Task E4:S08:T07 - Task Splitting Across Multiple Canonical Epics (FR-011)

**Task ID:** E4:S08:T07  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Feature Request:** [FR-011](../../../fr-br/FR-011-task-splitting-multiple-canonical-epics.md)

---

## Scope

Implement task-level split planning so mixed-responsibility source epics can map across multiple canonical epics, with explainable decision output and deterministic reference remapping.

---

## Input

- Existing semantic epic matching in Story 008 (FR-009 lineage).  
- [FR-011](../../../fr-br/FR-011-task-splitting-multiple-canonical-epics.md) requirements and acceptance criteria.
- [ICW-E4S08T07-specification](../../../../implementation-cycles/ICW-E4S08T07-specification.md)
- [ICW-E4S08T07-test-design](../../../../implementation-cycles/ICW-E4S08T07-test-design.md)
- [ICW-E4S08T07-implementation-plan](../../../../implementation-cycles/ICW-E4S08T07-implementation-plan.md)

---

## Deliverable

- Multi-epic split evaluator for candidate canonical epic sets.
- Split-plan output with rationale per task assignment.
- Deterministic ID/reference update path for split results.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FR-011 FR-1 through FR-6 mapped to implementation steps.
- [ ] FR-011 AC-1 through AC-6 covered by tests and examples.
- [ ] Task split decisions are explainable and reproducible.

---

## Dependencies

- Depends on: E4:S08 semantic matching baseline.
- Related: FR-009, FR-011.
