# Story 8: Intelligent Epic Matching and Canonical Structure Adoption

**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-09 (v0.4.8.7+1 – Kanban documentation setup)
**Version:** v0.4.8.7+1
**Code:** E4S08

---

## Goal

Implement intelligent epic matching with semantic analysis and AI-assisted task migration to enable users to adopt the canonical Kanban structure while intelligently mapping their existing tasks, preserving organizational quality and leveraging proven best practices.

- [ ] **E4:S08:T07 – FR-011: Task splitting across multiple canonical epics** - TODO
  - Implement multi-epic split logic when one source epic maps across several canonical epics.
  - Generate explainable split plans and deterministic reference updates per split task.
  - **Linked FR:** FR-011
  - **Acceptance:** FR-011 requirements and ACs mapped to executable split workflow.

## Implementation Notes

### Additional Requirements from GitHub Comments

**From Issue #7 Additional Context:**

1. **Template Task Installation (Two-Phase Migration):**
   - Phase 1: Migrate user tasks first (preserve IDs)
   - Phase 2: Install template tasks after (bump IDs - templates start after user tasks)
   - **Status:** IN PROGRESS

2. **Task Splitting Across Multiple Canonical Epics:**
   - When user epic partially matches multiple canonical epics, split tasks intelligently
   - Example: "Versioning & Release Workflow" → Split between Epic 2 and Epic 3
   - **Status:** IN PROGRESS

3. **Enhanced Match Decision Logic:**
   - Match decision matrix with different actions based on match type + number conflict
   - Edge case handling: multiple matches, same-number conflicts, etc.
   - **Status:** IN PROGRESS

**Recommended Follow-Up:**
- Create new task or story for template task installation (two-phase migration)
- Enhance task splitting logic for partial matches across multiple canonical epics
- Implement full match decision matrix with all edge cases
