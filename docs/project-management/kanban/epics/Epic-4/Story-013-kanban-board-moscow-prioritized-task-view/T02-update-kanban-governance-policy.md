# Epic 4, Story 13, Task 2: Update Kanban Governance Policy

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-18 (v0.4.13.2+1 – T02 COMPLETE: Kanban governance policy updated with MoSCOW prioritized task view)  
**Started:** 2025-12-18  
**Completed:** 2025-12-18  
**Version:** v0.4.13.2+1  
**Code:** E4S13T02

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E\{epic\}:S\{story\}:T\{task\}` (e.g., `E4:S13:T02`)

**Full Task ID:** `E4:S13:T02`

---

## Scope

Update the Kanban governance policy documents to document the new board structure with MoSCOW prioritized task view. This includes:
1. **Canonical Policy:** Update `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md` (canonical source of truth)
2. **Local Policy:** Update `docs/project-management/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md` (dev-kit local implementation)

**Policy Updates Required:**
- Document new board structure with MoSCOW sections
- Define MoSCOW priority levels and usage guidelines
- Define chronological ordering rules (most recently updated first)
- Document parent-child relationship (Board → Story → Task)
- Update board structure section to reflect new layout

**Dependencies:**
- Depends on T01 completion (enhanced board structure must be implemented first)

---

## Input

**Prerequisites:**
- T01 completed (enhanced Kanban board structure implemented)
- Current Kanban governance policy documents:
  - `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md` (canonical)
  - `docs/project-management/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md` (local)

- Enhanced Kanban board document (`docs/project-management/kanban/kanban-board.md`)

**Dependencies:**
- E4:S13:T01 – Design and implement MoSCOW prioritized task view in Kanban board

---

## Deliverable

**Updated Kanban Governance Policy Documents:**

1. **Updated `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`:**
   - New section documenting board structure with MoSCOW prioritized task view
   - MoSCOW priority levels defined:
     - **Must Have (M):** Critical in-progress tasks that must be completed
     - **Should Have (S):** Important in-progress tasks that should be completed
     - **Could Have (C):** Nice-to-have in-progress tasks that could be completed
     - **Won't Have (W):** Tasks that are deferred or not being done
   - Chronological ordering rules documented (most recently updated first)
   - Parent-child relationship documented (Board → Story → Task)
   - Board structure section updated to reflect new layout

2. **Updated `docs/project-management/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md`:**
   - Reflect new board structure in local policy
   - Document local implementation details
   - Reference canonical policy for framework-level details

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Canonical Kanban governance policy updated with new board structure
- [ ] MoSCOW priority levels defined and documented
- [ ] Chronological ordering rules documented
- [ ] Parent-child relationship (Board → Story → Task) documented
- [ ] Board structure section updated to reflect new layout
- [ ] Local Kanban governance policy updated to reflect new structure
- [ ] Both policy documents are consistent and accurate

---

## Approach

1. **Review Enhanced Board Structure:**
   - Review T01 deliverables (enhanced `kanban-board.md`)
   - Understand the new structure and format
   - Identify all aspects that need policy documentation

2. **Update Canonical Policy:**
   - Open `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`
   - Locate board structure section
   - Add new section documenting MoSCOW prioritized task view:
     - Board structure overview
     - MoSCOW section format
     - Priority level definitions
     - Chronological ordering rules
     - Parent-child relationship documentation
   - Update existing board structure section to reference new structure
   - Ensure consistency with framework-level documentation

3. **Update Local Policy:**
   - Open `docs/project-management/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md`
   - Locate board structure section
   - Update to reflect new board structure
   - Document local implementation details
   - Reference canonical policy for framework-level details
   - Ensure consistency with canonical policy

4. **Verify Policy Updates:**
   - Verify both policies are consistent
   - Verify all aspects of new structure are documented
   - Verify parent-child relationship is clearly explained
   - Verify MoSCOW priority levels are well-defined

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- E4:S13:T01 – Design and implement MoSCOW prioritized task view in Kanban board

**Blocks:**
- E4:S13:T03 – Update Kanban board template (template should reflect policy)

**Blocked By:**
- E4:S13:T01 (must have enhanced board structure to document)

**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Blocked (depends on T01)

## Version Anchor

**Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.13.2+1)`)

**When Task is Complete:**
- Add forensic marker to Task document
- Add forensic marker to Story checklist
- Update version file with task completion
- Update changelog with task completion

---

## Notes

**Policy Documentation Principles:**
- Canonical policy (`packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`) is the source of truth for framework-level documentation
- Local policy (`docs/project-management/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md`) documents project-specific implementation
- Both should be consistent, with local policy referencing canonical policy

**MoSCOW Priority Guidelines:**
- Priority should be determined based on task importance and urgency
- Default to "Should Have" if priority is not explicitly specified
- Priority can be updated as work progresses

---
