   - Status: Well documented

2. ✅ **Project Root Configuration**
   - Auto-detected from current working directory
   - Can be specified for validation
   - Status: Well documented

3. ⚠️ **Version File Path Configuration**
   - Validator checks for version file at expected path
   - Path may need to be configured for projects with different structures
   - Status: Documented but may need project-specific configuration

4. ✅ **Epic Numbering Configuration**
   - Canonical range: Epic 1-23
   - Project-specific range: Epic 24+
   - Status: Well documented and validated

**Configuration Status:** ✅ PASS - Well documented, minor improvement recommended for version file path

---

### Validation Scripts

**Script:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/scripts/validate_installation.py`

**Documentation Sources:**
- `packages/frameworks/kanban/scripts/validate_installation.py`
- `packages/frameworks/kanban/scripts/install_kanban_framework.py` (integration)

**Validation Checks:**

1. ✅ **Epic Numbering Validation**
   - Validates Epic 1-23 canonical, Epic 24+ project-specific
   - Detects Epic mashup (project-specific content in canonical range)
   - Status: Well implemented and documented

2. ✅ **Epic Mashup Detection**
   - Detects Epic 9 "Book Related Work" in canonical range
   - Detects Epic 24 "Book Related Work" (suggests copying ai-dev-kit's Kanban)
   - Status: Well implemented with clear error messages

3. ✅ **Canonical Conflict Detection**
   - Validates canonical vs project-specific epic conflicts
   - Status: Well implemented

4. ✅ **Version File Path Validation**
   - Checks for version file at expected path
   - Status: Implemented, may need project-specific configuration

5. ✅ **Kanban Structure Validation**
   - Validates KB structure (epics, stories, tasks)
   - Status: Well implemented

6. ✅ **AI Dev Kit Kanban Copy Detection**
   - Warns if ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban was copied
   - Status: Well implemented

**Validation Script Status:** ✅ PASS - Comprehensive validation with clear error messages

---

### Post-Install Checklist

**Required Steps:**

1. ✅ **Run Installation Validation**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/validate_installation.py --kanban-path docs/project-management/kanban
   ```
   - Expected: No errors, warnings may be present
   - Status: Well documented

2. ✅ **Verify Epic Structure**
   - Check canonical epics (1-23) are installed
   - Check project-specific epics (24+) are in correct range
   - Status: Well documented

3. ✅ **Verify Configuration Files**
   - Check `kanban-board.md` exists
   - Check epic documents exist
   - Status: Well documented

4. ⚠️ **Verify Version File Integration**
   - Check version file path matches project structure
   - May need project-specific configuration
   - Status: Documented but may need clarification

5. ✅ **Verify Validation Script Output**
   - Run validation script and verify output
   - Check for errors or warnings
   - Status: Well documented

**Post-Install Checklist Status:** ✅ PASS - Comprehensive checklist, minor improvement recommended

---

### Expected Outputs

**Installation Validation Output:**

**Success Case:**
```
✅ Validation passed - no issues found
```

**Warning Case:**
```
⚠️  WARNINGS (should be reviewed):
  ⚠️  Epic 24 'Book Related Work' detected. This suggests ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban was copied.
✅ Validation passed with warnings
```

**Error Case:**
```
❌ ERRORS (must be fixed before installation):
  ❌ CRITICAL: Epic 9 contains 'Book Related Work' but canonical Epic 9 is 
    'User Management and Authentication'. This is the root cause of Epic mashup.
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Clear, actionable output messages
