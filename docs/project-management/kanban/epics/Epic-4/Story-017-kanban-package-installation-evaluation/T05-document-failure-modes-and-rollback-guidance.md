## Failure Modes

### Failure Mode 1: Validation Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Installation blocked by validation errors
- Error messages about Epic mashup or conflicts
- Validation script reports errors

**Error Messages:**
```
❌ ERRORS (must be fixed before installation):
  ❌ CRITICAL: Epic 9 contains 'Book Related Work' but canonical Epic 9 is 
    'User Management and Authentication'. This is the root cause of Epic mashup.
```

**Root Causes:**
- Epic mashup (project-specific content in canonical range)
- Epic numbering conflicts
- Canonical conflicts detected
- Version file path issues

**Impact:** HIGH - Installation blocked until errors resolved

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Review validation errors
2. Fix Epic numbering issues (rename project epics to Epic 24+)
3. Resolve canonical conflicts
4. Re-run validation: `python3 scripts/validate_installation.py --kanban-path docs/project-management/kanban`
5. Re-run installation once validation passes

**Prevention:**
- Always use installer (don't manually copy epics)
- Use canonical templates (not ai-dev-kit's actual Kanban)
- Follow Epic numbering (Epic 1-23 canonical, Epic 24+ project-specific)

---

### Failure Mode 2: Migration Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Migration script fails with error
- Migration report shows errors
- Structure not migrated correctly

**Error Messages:**
```
❌ Migration failed: [error details]
```

**Root Causes:**
- Analysis report not found or invalid
- Backup creation failed
- File permission issues
- Disk space issues
- Invalid migration mode

**Impact:** HIGH - Migration incomplete, structure may be corrupted

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Check backup:** Verify backup was created before migration
2. **Restore from backup:**
   ```bash
   # Locate backup directory (created before migration)
   ls -la docs/project-management/_backup-*
   
   # Restore from backup
   rm -rf docs/project-management/kanban
   cp -r docs/project-management/_backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS docs/project-management/kanban
   ```
3. **Review error logs:** Check migration report for specific errors
4. **Fix root cause:** Address file permissions, disk space, or analysis report issues
5. **Re-run migration:** Use `--dry-run` first to preview changes

**Prevention:**
- Always run `--dry-run` before actual migration
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Verify file permissions before migration
- Review analysis report before proceeding

---

### Failure Mode 3: Backup Creation Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Backup creation fails or is cancelled
- Migration proceeds without backup
- No backup directory created

**Error Messages:**
```
❌ Error: Backup creation failed or was cancelled.
```

**Root Causes:**
- Insufficient disk space
- File permission issues
- Backup directory already exists (user cancelled)
- Path issues

**Impact:** CRITICAL - No rollback available if migration fails

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Manual backup before proceeding:**
   ```bash
   # Create manual backup
   cp -r docs/project-management/kanban docs/project-management/kanban-backup-manual
   ```
2. **Fix backup issues:**
   - Free up disk space
   - Fix file permissions
   - Remove existing backup directory if needed
3. **Re-run installation:** Backup will be created automatically

**Prevention:**
- Ensure sufficient disk space before installation
- Verify write permissions on kanban directory
- Review backup directory before installation

---

### Failure Mode 4: Configuration Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Configuration files not created correctly
- Path issues with kanban directory
- Version file integration fails

**Error Messages:**
```
⚠️  Warning: Version file not found at expected path
```

**Root Causes:**
- Project structure differs from expected
- Version file path not configured
- Kanban path misconfigured

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Installation may succeed but validation fails

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Verify kanban path:**
   ```bash
   # Check kanban directory exists
   ls -la docs/project-management/kanban
   ```
2. **Configure version file path:**
   - Update validator configuration if needed
   - Verify version file exists at expected path
3. **Re-run validation:** Verify configuration is correct

**Prevention:**
- Use standard project structure
- Configure version file path before installation
- Review configuration requirements in T04

---

### Failure Mode 5: Partial Installation

**Symptoms:**
- Installation starts but doesn't complete
- Some files created, others missing
- Inconsistent structure

**Error Messages:**
```
⚠️  Installation incomplete - some files may be missing
```

**Root Causes:**
- Installation interrupted
- Script errors during execution
- Disk space issues during installation

**Impact:** HIGH - Incomplete installation, structure may be inconsistent

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Assess damage:** Check what was installed vs. what's missing
2. **Restore from backup:** If backup exists, restore and restart
3. **Manual cleanup:** Remove partially installed files
4. **Re-run installation:** Start fresh installation

**Prevention:**
- Don't interrupt installation process
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Run installation in stable environment
