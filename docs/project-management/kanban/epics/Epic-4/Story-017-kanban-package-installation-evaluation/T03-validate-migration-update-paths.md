# E4:S17:T03 – Validate Migration/Update Paths

**Task ID:** E4:S17:T03  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Epic:** E4 – Kanban Framework  
**Story:** E4:S17 – Kanban Package Installation Evaluation  
**Version Anchor:** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.17.3+1)

---

## Scope

Validate migration and update paths for the Kanban framework package to ensure users can successfully migrate existing Kanban structures or update existing framework installations. This validation covers all supported migration/update modes and verifies that behavior is preserved during migration/update operations.

**Scope includes:**
- Review migration/update documentation and scripts

- Document validation results and findings
- Verify preserved behavior during migration/update
- Identify issues and gaps
- Provide recommendations for RC readiness

---

## Inputs
