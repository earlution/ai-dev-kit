## Overview

Split the Kanban board into two documents: structured information only (`kanban-board.md`) and rules/explanations (`kanban-board-guide.md`). This reduces cognitive load when skimming the board by removing all non-informational content.

---

## Goals

- [x] Create `kanban-board-guide.md` with all rules, explanations, and how-to content
- [x] Strip `kanban-board.md` to structured information only (tasks, epics, status, links)
- [x] Add cross-references between documents
- [x] Update templates and governance policy to reflect the split (T02)

---

## Implementation Notes

- The three-way split reduces cognitive load while maintaining comprehensive project management
- Each document serves a specific purpose: tasks (MoSCOW), structure (hierarchy), rules (guidance)
- Cross-references between documents ensure navigation and context preservation
- Framework templates updated to generate three-way split for new installations
