# T04 – Review Integrations and Dependency Alignment

**Task ID:** E4:S16:T04  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium  
**Created:** 2026-01-19  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-19 (v0.4.16.4+1 – Integration review complete: Kanban ↔ Versioning ↔ RW/UKW alignment validated)  
**Version:** v0.4.16.4+1  
**Code:** E4S16T04

---

## Scope

Review and validate the integration points and dependency alignment between the **Kanban framework package**, the **Numbering & Versioning package**, and the **Workflow Management package** (Release Workflow + UKW). Confirm that documented integration behavior matches the dev-kit implementation and that there are no hidden coupling or dependency issues that would block RC sign-off.

---

## Input

- **Kanban ↔ Versioning Integration Guide:**  
  `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/numbering-versioning-integration.md`


- **Kanban ↔ Workflow Management Integration Guide:**  
  `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/workflow-management-integration.md`


- **Governance Policy:**  
  `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`


- **Release Workflow Definition & Docs:**  
  - `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/release-workflow.yaml`  
  - `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-reference.md`  
  - `.cursorrules` (RW section – dual tagging, SemVer integration, GitHub release)


- **Update Kanban Workflow (UKW):**  
  - `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/update-kanban-workflow.yaml`


- **Dev-Kit Kanban Implementation:**  
  - `docs/project-management/kanban/kboard.md`  
  - `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-4/Epic-4.md`  
  - `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-4/Story-016-kanban-package-implementation-review.md`


---

## Deliverable

An **integration alignment report** confirming:

- How Kanban integrates with Numbering & Versioning (forensic markers, Story/Epic headers).
- How Kanban integrates with Workflow Management (RW, validators, automatic Kanban updates).
- How UKW uses Kanban structures and perpetual tasks.
- Whether dev-kit’s actual implementation matches the integration guides.
- Any gaps, risks, or misalignments that could impact RC sign-off.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Integration points between Kanban and Numbering & Versioning reviewed and documented. ✅ COMPLETE

## Integration Alignment Findings

### 1. Kanban ↔ Numbering & Versioning

**Documentation Source:** `integration/numbering-versioning-integration.md`

**Key Expectations:**
- Version schema: `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` (RC=0 for development).
- Story/Epic documents carry **forensic markers** in checklists and headers.
- Tasks use `E\{epic\}:S\{story\}:T\{task\}` naming and record versions in completion lines.
- Epic headers record `Last updated` with version and short summary.

**Dev-Kit Implementation:**
- Kanban board and Epic/Story docs use `vRC.E.S.T+B` consistently (e.g., `v0.4.16.2+1`).
- Story 016 checklist uses version markers as SoT (for T01/T02/T03).
- Epic 4 document tracks story status with version markers.

**Conclusion:** ✅ **Integration aligned**
- Version schema and forensic marker usage match the integration guide.
- No conflicting patterns or legacy date-only markers for the Kanban framework.

---

### 2. Kanban ↔ Workflow Management (Release Workflow)

**Documentation Sources:**
- `integration/workflow-management-integration.md`
- `workflows/release-workflow.yaml`
- RW reference docs + `.cursorrules`

**Key Expectations:**
- RW is the canonical mechanism for updating Kanban docs with versions.
- Step 4 / Step 7 (depending on version) perform **auto-update of Kanban docs**:
  - Epic headers (`Last updated` + version summary).
  - Story Checklists and detailed sections (forensic markers, status).

- RW uses ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern.
- RW integrates with Kanban governance (KG-IP1/KG-IP2) and validation scripts.

**Dev-Kit Implementation:**
- `release-workflow.yaml` includes a **kanban_update** step wired to `update_kanban_docs.py`.
- `.cursorrules` RW section requires Kanban updates and traces version ↔ task alignment.
- Recent RWs for Kanban work (E4:S16, E4:S17, E4:S14) updated:
  - Kanban board (MoSCOW sections, Epics summary, Story Checklist).
  - Epic 4 and Story 016 metadata (`Last updated`, `Version`, task status).


**Conclusion:** ✅ **Integration aligned**
- The installed RW configuration matches the integration guide’s expectations.
- Kanban updates are driven through RW, not ad-hoc/manual scripts.

---

### 3. Kanban ↔ UKW (Update Kanban Workflow)

**Documentation Source:** `update-kanban-workflow.yaml` + Kanban governance policy.

**Key Expectations:**
- UKW performs **bottom-up Kanban synchronization** (Tasks → Stories → Epics → Board).
- Uses Kanban’s perpetual task for UKW (E6:S07:T101, with `perpetual_task: true`).
- Uses Kanban document structure (`kanban_root`, `epic_doc_pattern`, `story_doc_pattern`, `task_doc_pattern`).

**Dev-Kit Implementation:**
- UKW config points to dev-kit Kanban paths under `docs/project-management/kanban`.
- Perpetual UKW task wired as E6:S07:T101 (confirmed in Epic 6 + Kanban board).
- UKW runs have updated:
  - Task/Story/Epic statuses and `Last updated` fields.
  - MoSCOW board entries (with BR-034 tracking a prior prioritization gap).


**Conclusion:** ✅ **Integration aligned (with known UKW MoSCOW bug tracked via BR-034)**
- Structural and path-level alignment is correct.
- Behavior-level gap (MoSCOW prioritization) is already captured in BR-034 and not a Kanban-package integration flaw.

---

### 4. Dependency Assumptions (Hard vs Soft)

**From Kanban README and Governance Policy:**
- **Hard dependencies:** Git + Markdown.
- **Soft dependencies:** Numbering & Versioning, Workflow Management.
- Kanban can run **standalone**, but fully-featured integration uses both packages.

**Dev-Kit Implementation:**
- Kanban package is installed alongside both frameworks in `packages/frameworks/`.
- Documentation and policies clearly describe optional vs required dependencies.
- No circular dependency detected between Kanban, Versioning, and Workflow Management.

**Conclusion:** ✅ **Dependency alignment correct**
- Dependency graph is consistent with documentation.
- Projects can, in principle, consume Kanban without installing the other packages.

---

## Risks & Gaps

- **Risk Level:** LOW  
- **Findings:**  
  - No structural or configuration misalignments found between Kanban and its dependencies.  
  - Known behavior bug (UKW MoSCOW prioritization, BR-034) is **tracked as workflow behavior**, not an integration-wiring defect within the Kanban package itself.


**RC Impact:**  
- No integration issues that would block RC sign-off for the Kanban package.

---

## Summary

**Overall Integration Status:** ✅ **COMPLIANT / RC-READY**

- Kanban ↔ Numbering & Versioning: **Aligned.**  
- Kanban ↔ Workflow Management (RW): **Aligned.**  
- Kanban ↔ UKW: **Aligned structurally; behavior bug tracked separately.**  
- Dependency model (hard vs soft): **Aligned.**

No additional remediation tasks are required from an integration and dependency alignment perspective. Any remaining work is captured in other stories/tasks (e.g., BR-034 for UKW behavior).

---

## Notes

- This task focuses on **framework-level integration alignment**, not individual bug behavior inside workflows.  
- BR-034 and BR-035 demonstrate that integration wiring is in place and that Kanban + Workflow Management are being exercised in real workflows; the remaining issues are workflow behavior refinements rather than structural misalignment.
