# E4:S16:T06 – Define RC sign-off criteria and remediation tasks

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-22 (RC sign-off criteria defined, gap log reviewed, all acceptance criteria met)  
**Started:** 2026-01-20  
**Completed:** 2026-01-22  
**Version:** v0.4.16.6+1  
**Epic:** E4 – Kanban Framework  
**Story:** E4:S16 – Kanban Package Implementation Review  

---

## Purpose

This task defines the **Release Candidate (RC) sign-off criteria** for the Kanban framework package and the **remediation task pattern** for any non-blocking gaps identified during implementation review.

The goal is to:

- Make RC sign-off **explicit, checkable, and repeatable** across projects.
- Ensure every non-blocking gap has a **concrete remediation path** (task(s), owner, target epic/story).
- Keep the Kanban package **RC-ready by default**, with gaps tracked in Kanban rather than hidden in narratives.

---

## Inputs

- E4:S16:T01 – Expectations baseline for Kanban package  
- E4:S16:T02 – Component inventory and mapping  
- E4:S16:T03 – Behavioral validation notes  
- E4:S16:T04 – Integration and dependency alignment report  
- E4:S16:T05 – Gap log and RC risk assessment  
- Kanban governance policy and package README  

---

## Deliverables

1. **RC sign-off checklist** for the Kanban framework package, suitable for reuse in:
   - E4:S16 story acceptance criteria
   - E9:S02 – Kanban Framework RC Readiness Review
2. **Remediation task pattern** describing:
   - How to capture non-blocking gaps as tasks/FRs/BRs
   - How to attach them to the correct Epic/Story
   - How they affect (or do not block) RC sign-off

---

## RC sign-off criteria (Kanban package)

The Kanban framework package is considered **RC-ready** when **all** of the following criteria are satisfied:

1. **Governance and policy alignment**
   - [ ] Governance policy in `packages/frameworks/kanban/` matches the dev-kit Kanban governance policy (no hard contradictions).
   - [ ] Core rules are represented: Task-driven work, FR/BR → Task → Story → Epic, repository stories (S00/S01 pattern), MoSCOW prioritization.
   - [ ] Any intentional deviations are **documented as design decisions** (not silent drift).

2. **Structure and templates**
   - [ ] Epic/Story/Task templates in the package match the **canonical E/S/T structure** in this repo (fields, lifecycle metadata, checklists).
   - [ ] Templates support **perpetual stories** (S00, repository stories) and **perpetual tasks** (Ongoing / UKW / CMW).
   - [ ] Example documents do not contradict the templates or governance rules.

3. **Integration alignment**
   - [ ] Numbering & Versioning integration points (E3) are accurate:
     - Version schema references are correct.
     - Examples map Tasks → `TASK` component in version numbers.
   - [ ] Workflow Management (RW) integration points (E2) are accurate:
     - RW updates Kanban docs in the same direction as the package describes.
     - UKW/CMW context is represented (or explicitly deferred with tasks).

4. **Gap log and risk posture**
   - [ ] Gap log exists for the Kanban package with:
     - Description, severity, likelihood, and RC impact for each gap.
     - Clear classification into **RC-blocking** vs **non-blocking**.
   - [ ] There are **no unresolved RC-blocking gaps** in the Kanban framework package itself.
   - [ ] Non-blocking gaps are either:
     - Documented as intentional trade-offs, or
     - Captured as remediation tasks (see next section).

5. **Doc lifecycle and traceability**
   - [ ] All package docs included in RC sign-off have lifecycle metadata (`lifecycle`, `created_at`, `housekeeping_policy`).
   - [ ] Key package docs (README, governance policy, installer/migration guides) reference:
     - Where to find canonical SoT in `ai-dev-kit`.
     - How to wire Kanban ↔ Versioning ↔ RW in consumer projects.
   - [ ] There is a clear mapping from:
     - Package version ↔ dev-kit internal version ↔ SemVer ↔ Epic/Story/Task.

---

## Remediation task pattern

Non-blocking gaps discovered during E4:S16 must be **externalized** into Kanban so that:

- RC sign-off remains truthful (no hidden work).
- Future work is discoverable and traceable.

For each **non-blocking** gap:

1. **Create a task or FR/BR**
   - Choose the owning epic:
     - Epic 4 (Kanban Framework) for pure Kanban issues.
     - Epic 2 (Workflow Mgt) or Epic 3 (Versioning) for cross-framework issues.
   - Create:
     - A **Task document** under the appropriate Story, or
     - An **FR/BR document** under `fr-br/` if it represents an external request/bug.

2. **Record key metadata**
   - Link back to E4:S16 gap log entry.
   - Include severity, likelihood, and RC impact.
   - Note whether it is:
     - `Must fix before GA` (post-RC),
     - `Should fix when feasible`, or
     - `Document-only remediation`.

3. **Wire to RC sign-off**
   - In the E4:S16 story:
     - Reference the remediation task/FR/BR in the gap log.
     - Mark the gap as **“tracked in Kanban”**.
   - In Epic 9 RC readiness docs:
     - Reflect that RC sign-off is granted **with known non-blocking gaps**, each with an explicit remediation path.

---

## Approach

1. **Synthesize T01–T05 outputs** into a single RC perspective on the Kanban package.
2. **Define the RC checklist** above, ensuring it can be reused for:
   - E4:S16 story completion,
   - E9:S02 RC readiness review,
   - Future consumer projects adopting the Kanban package.
3. **Define the remediation pattern** so gaps are always represented as Tasks/FRs/BRs, not just narrative bullets.
4. **Update Story 016 and Epic 4** to reference this task once RC sign-off is complete (via RW).

## RC Sign-Off Review (Completed)

### Gap Log Review Against RC Criteria

**Review Date:** 2026-01-22

**Gap Log Status (from E4:S16:T05):**
- ✅ **Gap 1:** UKW MoSCOW Prioritization - Tracked in BR-034/E6:S01:T34 (✅ COMPLETE v0.6.1.34+2)
- ✅ **Gap 2:** RW Housekeeping - Tracked in BR-035/E6:S01:T35 (✅ FIXED v0.6.1.35+1)
- ✅ **Gap 3:** Env Var Setup Friction - MITIGATED (SOP + `.env.local` pattern introduced)

**RC-Blocking Gaps:** **NONE**

**Conclusion:** All gaps identified in E4:S16:T05 are either:
- Tracked in Kanban (BRs/Tasks) with remediation paths, or
- Mitigated through operational improvements (SOP, patterns)

**No RC-blocking gaps remain** in the Kanban framework package itself.

### Remediation Task Verification

All non-blocking gaps from the gap log are properly tracked:
- ✅ Gap 1: Externalized as BR-034 → E6:S01:T34 (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Gap 2: Externalized as BR-035 → E6:S01:T35 (FIXED)
- ✅ Gap 3: Mitigated via SOP and operational patterns (no task needed)

**All gaps are wired into Kanban** with explicit remediation paths.

1. **Governance and policy alignment** ✅

   - No undocumented deviations

2. **Structure and templates** ✅
   - Templates match canonical E/S/T structure
   - Perpetual stories/tasks supported
   - Examples align with templates

3. **Integration alignment** ✅
   - Numbering & Versioning integration points accurate
   - Workflow Management (RW) integration points accurate
   - UKW/CMW context represented

4. **Gap log and risk posture** ✅
   - Gap log exists with all required metadata
   - **No RC-blocking gaps** in Kanban package
   - Non-blocking gaps tracked in Kanban

5. **Doc lifecycle and traceability** ✅
   - Package docs have lifecycle metadata
   - Key docs reference canonical SoT
   - Version mapping clear

**RC Sign-Off Status:** ✅ **READY FOR RC SIGN-OFF**
