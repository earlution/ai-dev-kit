# Epic 5, Story 1, Task 44: RW Temporary Execution Log for Recovery and Forensics

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-22 (v0.5.1.44+0 – Task created)  
**Started:** [TBD]  
**Completed:** [TBD]  
**Version:** v0.5.1.44+0  
**Code:** E5S01T44

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`

**Full Task ID:** `E5:S01:T44`

**Repository Pattern:** FR-044 = E5:S01:T44 (abstract space: v0.5.1.44+0)

---

## Scope

Add a temporary execution log file to RW that is written during execution. Enables (a) recovery of aborted runs (e.g. IDE crashes), and (b) forensic analysis of workflow behavior.

---

## Input

- **FR-044:** [FR-044-rw-temporary-execution-log-for-recovery-and-forensics.md](../../../fr-br/FR-044-rw-temporary-execution-log-for-recovery-and-forensics.md)
- **RW Agent Guide:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/docs/documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
- **rw-config.yaml:** Project config for paths

---

## Deliverable

1. RW creates/opens a log file at start of execution
2. Each RW step writes start and completion (or failure) to the log
3. Log includes sufficient context for recovery (step number, key outputs, file paths)
4. Log path configurable via rw-config.yaml (optional)
5. Documented in RW agent execution guide

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] RW creates/opens log file at start
- [ ] Each step writes start and completion to log
- [ ] Log includes step number, key outputs, file paths
- [ ] Log path configurable via rw-config.yaml
- [ ] Documented in RW agent execution guide
