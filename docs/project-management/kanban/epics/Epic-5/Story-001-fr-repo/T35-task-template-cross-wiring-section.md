# Epic 5, Story 0, Task 35: Task Template Cross-Wiring Section

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-16 (v0.5.1.35+0 – Task created)  
**Started:** [TBD]  
**Completed:** [TBD]  
**Version:** v0.5.1.35+0  
**Code:** E5S00T35

---

## Task ID

**Format:** `E\{epic\}:S\{story\}:T\{task\}`

**Full Task ID:** `E5:S01:T35`

**Repository Pattern:** FR-035 = E5:S01:T35 (abstract space: v0.5.1.35+0)

---

## Scope

Enhance the Task Template (`TASK_TEMPLATE.md`) to include an explicit "Cross-Wiring" or "Interconnected Tasks" section that provides clear guidance on linking related tasks, emphasizes bidirectional wiring, and contextualizes relationships between interconnected tasks.

**Problem Statement:**
- Task template lacks explicit cross-wiring guidance
- No emphasis on bidirectional wiring in template
- No relationship types or context guidance
- Users may create one-way links instead of bidirectional
- Interconnected tasks may not be properly contextualized

**Solution:**
- Add explicit "Cross-Wiring" or "Interconnected Tasks" section to template
- Emphasize bidirectional wiring (links go both ways)
- Include relationship types (complements, coordinates with, informs, follows, precedes, related to)
- Provide context guidance (why tasks are related)
- Reference bidirectional wiring principle and cross-wiring SoP
- Distinguish between "Dependencies" (blocking) and "Cross-Wiring" (contextual)
- Include examples of proper cross-wiring patterns

---

## Input

- **FR-035:** [`FR-035-task-template-cross-wiring-section.md`](../../../fr-br/FR-035-task-template-cross-wiring-section.md)
- **SoP:** [`task-template-cross-wiring-sop.md`](../../../../architecture/standards-and-adrs/task-template-cross-wiring-sop.md) - Standard Operating Procedure for cross-wiring tasks
- **Task Template:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/TASK_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Bidirectional Wiring Principle:** `docs/project-management/kanban/fr-br/BIDIRECTIONAL_WIRING_PRINCIPLE.md`
- **Epic 4:** Kanban Framework
- **Epic 5:** Documentation Management

---

## Deliverable

**Enhanced Task Template** that includes:

1. **Explicit "Cross-Wiring" or "Interconnected Tasks" Section:**
   - Clear guidance on linking related tasks
   - Emphasis on bidirectional wiring (links go both ways)
   - Relationship types (complements, coordinates with, informs, follows, precedes, related to)
   - Context guidance (why tasks are related)
   - Examples of proper cross-wiring patterns

2. **Enhanced "Related Work" Section:**
   - Better guidance on bidirectional wiring
   - Reference to bidirectional wiring principle
   - Reference to cross-wiring SoP
   - Examples of proper cross-wiring patterns

3. **Clear Distinction:**
   - Distinction between "Dependencies" (blocking/depends-on) and "Cross-Wiring" (related/interconnected)
   - Guidance on when to use each section

4. **Integration:**
   - Reference to bidirectional wiring principle (`BIDIRECTIONAL_WIRING_PRINCIPLE.md`)
   - Reference to cross-wiring SoP (`task-template-cross-wiring-sop.md`)
   - Alignment with SoP guidance and best practices

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Criterion 1:** Task template includes explicit "Cross-Wiring" or "Interconnected Tasks" section
- [ ] **Criterion 2:** Template emphasizes bidirectional wiring (links go both ways)
- [ ] **Criterion 3:** Template includes relationship types (complements, coordinates with, informs, follows, precedes, related to)
- [ ] **Criterion 4:** Template provides context guidance (why tasks are related)
- [ ] **Criterion 5:** Template references bidirectional wiring principle
- [ ] **Criterion 6:** Template references cross-wiring SoP
- [ ] **Criterion 7:** Template distinguishes between "Dependencies" and "Cross-Wiring"
- [ ] **Criterion 8:** Template includes examples of proper cross-wiring patterns
- [ ] **Criterion 9:** Enhanced "Related Work" section with better guidance
- [ ] **Criterion 10:** Template aligns with bidirectional wiring principle and SoP guidance

---

## Approach

1. **Review Existing Template:** Read current `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` to understand structure
2. **Review SoP:** Thoroughly review `task-template-cross-wiring-sop.md` for complete guidance
3. **Review Bidirectional Wiring Principle:** Understand the core principle
4. **Design New Section:** Create "Cross-Wiring" section following SoP guidance
5. **Enhance Related Work:** Update "Related Work" section with bidirectional wiring guidance
6. **Add Examples:** Include examples of proper cross-wiring patterns
7. **Add References:** Link to bidirectional wiring principle and SoP
8. **Distinguish Sections:** Clearly distinguish "Dependencies" from "Cross-Wiring"
9. **Validate:** Ensure template aligns with SoP and bidirectional wiring principle
10. **Document:** Update template documentation and examples

---

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- Completion of `task-template-cross-wiring-sop.md` (SoP created)
- Understanding of bidirectional wiring principle
- Access to current task template

**Blocks:**
- Clear cross-wiring patterns for task documentation
- Bidirectional wiring enforcement
- Better task relationship documentation

**Blocked By:**
- None (can start immediately)

**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe because this is template enhancement work that does not modify core code.

## Version Anchor

**Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.5.1.35+1)`)

**When Task is Complete:**
- Add forensic marker to Task document
- Add forensic marker to Story checklist
- Update `Last updated` field
- Update `Completed` field
- Update `Status` to `COMPLETE`
- Update `Version` to final version
- Update `Epic-5` with completion status and version
- Update `kanban-board.md` with completion status and version

---

## Notes

**Key Considerations:**
- The template enhancement must align with the SoP guidance
- Bidirectional wiring is mandatory (links must go both ways)
- Relationship types should be standardized and consistent
- Context is crucial for understanding task relationships
- Examples should be clear and practical

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Clear, actionable guidance for cross-wiring tasks
- Improved traceability and discoverability of task relationships
- Standardized cross-wiring patterns across all task documents
- Better understanding of task interdependencies
- Enhanced knowledge management and project transparency
