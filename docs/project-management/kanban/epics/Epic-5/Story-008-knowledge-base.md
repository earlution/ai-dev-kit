# Story 008 – Knowledge Base

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Created:** 2025-12-18  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-22 (v0.5.8.2+5 – T02: KB migration log, stub sweep MCP args)  
**Version:** v0.5.8.2+5  
**Code:** E5S08

**Note:** This story was renumbered from S07 to S08 as part of the repository story abstract space resolution (E9:S01:T08).

## Task Checklist

- [ ] **E5:S08:T01 – Investigate persistent knowledge base concept and ramifications** - TODO
- [x] **E5:S08:T02 – Notion hub, Knowledge Base container, and KB index** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.5.8.2+5)

---

## Overview

This story investigates the ramifications of the "Persistent Knowledge Base" concept that has been integrated into the canonical KB structure. The concept defines a local, curated, version-controlled knowledge library that persists across sessions and is managed by agents. This investigation will assess the implications, requirements, and potential impacts on workflows, tooling, and documentation practices.

---

## Goal

Understand the full scope and implications of the persistent knowledge base concept, including:
- Impact on existing workflows (especially RW Step 9)
- Tooling and automation requirements
- Agent capabilities and limitations
- Integration with Cursor indexing and vectorization
- Maintenance and curation overhead
- Best practices and anti-patterns

## Tasks

### E5:S08:T01 – Investigate persistent knowledge base concept and ramifications

**Scope:** Comprehensive investigation of the persistent knowledge base concept, its integration points, requirements, and implications for the ADK framework.

**Input:** 
- `docs/knowledge/README.md` (persistent KB concept)
- `docs/knowledge/guides/building-persistent-knowledge.md` (foundational concept document: Building Persistent Knowledge in Cursor)
- `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/ultimate-canonical-kb-structure.md` (KB structure with persistent KB integration)
- `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/ultimate-canonical-workflow-structure.md` (RW Step 9: Update Knowledge Base)
- Existing knowledge base content and structure

**Deliverable:** 
- Investigation report documenting:
  - Concept analysis and scope
  - Integration points and dependencies
  - Workflow impacts (RW, Intake, PIR, etc.)
  - Tooling and automation requirements
  - Agent capability requirements
  - Cursor integration considerations
  - Maintenance and curation strategies
  - Risk assessment
  - Recommendations and next steps

**Dependencies:** None  
**Blocker:** None  
**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe (investigation/documentation only)

**Approach:**
1. Review persistent KB concept documentation (including `building-persistent-knowledge.md`)
2. Analyze integration with existing workflows
3. Assess agentic management requirements (multi-agent systems, web search, file save capabilities)
4. Evaluate Cursor integration capabilities (indexing, vectorization, search)
5. Review taxonomical standards and SoP requirements from foundational document
6. Identify tooling and automation needs
7. Assess maintenance and curation overhead
8. Document risks and mitigation strategies
9. Provide recommendations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Investigation report created
- [ ] Concept scope clearly defined
- [ ] All integration points identified
- [ ] Workflow impacts documented
- [ ] Tooling requirements specified
- [ ] Agent capability requirements defined
- [ ] Cursor integration approach documented
- [ ] Maintenance strategy outlined
- [ ] Risks identified and assessed
- [ ] Recommendations provided

### E5:S08:T02 – Notion hub, Knowledge Base container, and KB index

**Scope:** Establish Notion project hub and Knowledge Base container (RMS Teamspace), wire repo via `notion_hub_url`, and index project KB for optimization and migration.

**Deliverables:** Notion AI Dev Kit hub page; Knowledge Base container under hub; `rw-config.yaml` and `.cursorrules` hub reference; `scripts/kb_index.py`, `docs/knowledge/KB-INDEX.md`, `docs/knowledge/KB-INDEX.json`; story renamed to "Knowledge Base".

**Task:** [T02-notion-hub-and-kb-index.md](Story-008-knowledge-base/T02-notion-hub-and-kb-index.md)
