## Overview

This document tracks all **completed FRs (Feature Requests), BRs (Bug Reports), and UXRs (User Experience Research)** across the AI Dev Kit project. Items are organized by type with completion dates, version markers, and references to implementing tasks for forensic tracking.

**Completion Criteria:** An FR/BR/UXR is marked COMPLETE only when:
- **Implementation is fully done** (code or docs delivered, released in a version)
- **Sign-off is obtained** (validated, accepted by the responsible party)
- **Associated tasks are completed** (if converted to Kanban tasks)

## Completed User Experience Research

*No historical UXR entries recorded outside recent dashboard yet.*

---

## Completion Process

### When an FR/BR/UXR is Completed:
1. **Implementation Complete** - All code/docs delivered and released
2. **Validation Done** - Implementation tested and accepted
3. **Task Completion** - Associated Kanban tasks marked complete
4. **Board Update** - Move from `fbuboard.md` to this completed board
5. **Documentation** - Record completion details and impact

### For FRs Converted to Tasks:
- Track both FR completion and implementing task completion
- Reference the specific task(s) that implemented the FR
- Note the version where the implementation was released

### For BRs:
- Record the fix implementation and testing results
- Note the version where the bug was resolved
- Reference any associated tasks that addressed the bug

### For UXRs:
- Document research findings and recommendations
- Note any implementation changes based on research
- Reference follow-up tasks or actions taken

---

## Historical Reference

### Completed Items by Implementation:
- **FR-051** → **E6:S06:T01** → **v0.6.7.107+1** - FR/BR/UXR Prioritization Board

### Completion Patterns:
- **FR → Task Flow:** Feature Requests typically convert to Kanban tasks before implementation
- **Direct Implementation:** Some FRs/BRs may be implemented directly without task conversion
- **Research Integration:** UXR items often inform multiple subsequent FRs and tasks

---

## Integration with Kanban System

### Cross-Reference System:
- **FR/BR/UXR Documents** → **Kanban Tasks** → **Implementation** → **Completion**
- Each completed item references its implementing task(s)
- Kanban tasks reference their originating FR/BR/UXR documents

### Workflow Integration:
- **Intake Workflow** creates FR/BR/UXR documents
- **Task Creation** converts FR/BR/UXRs to Kanban tasks (when appropriate)
- **Implementation** completes the task and delivers the feature/fix
- **Completion Tracking** records the final completion in this document

---

## Usage Guidelines

### For Adding Completed Items:
1. **Verify Completion** - Ensure implementation is fully complete and released
2. **Gather Details** - Collect completion date, version, and implementing task info
3. **Document Impact** - Describe what was implemented and its impact
4. **Update Board** - Remove from `fbuboard.md` and add to this completed board
5. **Cross-Reference** - Ensure bidirectional references between FR/BR/UXR and tasks

### For Reference:
1. **Look Up Completed Items** - Use this document to find completed FR/BR/UXRs
2. **Track Implementation History** - See which tasks implemented which FR/BR/UXRs
3. **Analyze Patterns** - Review completion patterns for process improvement
4. **Avoid Duplication** - Check completed items before creating similar FR/BR/UXRs

---

*This document provides historical tracking and reference for completed FR/BR/UXR items, ensuring complete lifecycle visibility from intake through completion.*
