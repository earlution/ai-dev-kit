## 1. Kanban Structure Analysis

### 1.1 Structure Overview

- **Epic Count:** 10 epics (Epics 1-10)
- **Story Count:** ~100+ stories across epics
- **Task Count:** Multiple tasks per story
- **Directory Structure:** `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-X/`
- **File Organization:** Nested (Epic → Story → Task directories)

**Epic Inventory:**
- **Epics 1-9:** Framework epics from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure ❌ **MASHUP**
- **Epic 9:** "Book Related Work" ❌ **INAPPROPRIATE FOR RULES PROJECT**
- **Epic 10:** "Internationalization and Localization" ✅ **APPROPRIATE** (multi-IDE support)

### 1.2 Distance from ADK Canonical Structure

**Comparison to ADK Canonical:**

**Epic Structure:** ❌ **CRITICAL MASHUP ISSUE**
- **Epics 1-9:** Framework epics from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure (dev-kit repo)
  - Epic 1: AI Dev Kit Core (framework epic)
  - Epic 2: Workflow Management Framework
  - Epic 3: Numbering & Versioning Framework
  - Epic 4: Kanban Framework
  - Epic 5: Documentation Management and Maintenance
  - Epic 6: Framework Management and Maintenance
  - Epic 7: Codebase Maintenance and Review
  - Epic 8: Tooling & Automation
  - **Epic 9: Book Related Work** ❌ **INAPPROPRIATE FOR RULES PROJECT**
- **Epic 10:** "Internationalization and Localization" ✅ **APPROPRIATE** (multi-IDE support)

**Root Cause:** Project manually copied ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure instead of using Kanban package template (see BR-kanban-installation-issue.md)

**Impact:** 
- Confusion about which epics are relevant
- Epic 9 "Book Related Work" has no relevance to rules project
- Clutters Kanban board with framework infrastructure epics
- Makes it unclear what the actual project work is
- Project discovered issue and reported it (self-aware)

**Story Structure:** ✅ **MATCHES**
- Stories organized under Epic directories
- Story naming follows pattern: `Story-XXX-description.md`
- Story documents include proper frontmatter

**Task Structure:** ✅ **MATCHES**
- Tasks organized in Story subdirectories
- Task documents follow pattern: `Task-YYY-description.md` or `TYYY-description.md`
- Tasks have proper structure and metadata

**Naming Conventions:** ✅ **MATCHES**
- Epic naming: `Epic-X/Epic-X.md`
- Story naming: `Story-XXX-description.md`
- Task naming: `Task-YYY-description.md` or `TYYY-description.md`

**File Organization:** ✅ **MATCHES**
- Nested structure: `epics/Epic-X/Story-XXX/Task-YYY.md`
- Consistent with ADK canonical

**Drift Assessment:**
- **Severity:** **CRITICAL** (mashup issue, but self-aware)
- **Root Cause:** Manual copy of ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure instead of using installer
- **Impact:** Confusion, inappropriate epics, unclear project boundaries, but project discovered and reported issue

### 1.3 Good Practices

✅ **What Works Well:**

1. **Self-Awareness**
   - Project discovered mashup issue and reported it (BR-kanban-installation-issue.md)
   - Good documentation of the problem
   - Clear understanding of what went wrong

2. **Proper Framework Installation**
   - Frameworks installed via Git submodule in `packages/frameworks/`
   - Entire ai-dev-kit repo as submodule (unusual but functional)
   - Clean separation between frameworks and project code

3. **Correct KB Structure**
   - KB structure matches ADK canonical exactly (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/`)
   - Proper directory organization
   - Good separation of concerns

4. **Proper Version File**
   - Version file at `src/agentic_ide_rules/version.py`
   - Using RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD schema correctly
   - Version tracking integrated with Kanban

5. **RW Configuration**
   - `rw-config-agentic-ide-rules.yaml` properly configured
   - Kanban integration enabled
   - Proper path mappings

6. **Workflow Integration**
   - `.cursorrules` includes RW trigger section (13-step workflow)
   - Good integration with Kanban
   - Proper workflow documentation

7. **Epic 10 Appropriateness**
   - Epic 10 "Internationalization" is appropriate for multi-IDE rules project
   - Shows good understanding of project needs

### 1.4 Bad Practices

❌ **What Doesn't Work:**

1. **CRITICAL: Epic Mashup**
   - **Issue:** Epics 1-9 from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure mixed with project
   - **Problem:** Epic 9 "Book Related Work" has no relevance to rules project
   - **Impact:** Confusion, clutter, unclear project boundaries
   - **Root Cause:** Manual copy instead of using installer (documented in BR)
   - **Note:** Project discovered and reported issue (self-aware)

2. **Manual Copy Instead of Installer**
   - **Issue:** Manually copied epics instead of using `install_kanban_framework.py`
   - **Problem:** Missed interactive installation process
   - **Impact:** Got ai-dev-kit's actual epics instead of canonical templates
   - **Documentation:** Issue documented in BR-kanban-installation-issue.md

3. **Framework Epics in Project Kanban**
   - **Issue:** Epics 1-8 are framework infrastructure epics, not project epics
   - **Problem:** These epics belong to ai-dev-kit repo, not client projects
   - **Impact:** Confusion about what work belongs to the project vs. framework

4. **Entire ai-dev-kit Repo as Submodule**
   - **Issue:** Entire ai-dev-kit repo in `packages/frameworks/ai-dev-kit/`
   - **Problem:** Unusual pattern - typically only frameworks are submoduled
   - **Impact:** Minor - works but unusual, may cause confusion

### 1.5 Mashup Issues

🔀 **Mixing ADK Components:**

1. **Epic 9 "Book Related Work" in Rules Project**
   - **Description:** Epic 9 from ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure present in rules project
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL - Epic has no relevance to rules project
   - **Root Cause:** Manual copy of ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure instead of using installer
   - **Evidence:** `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-9/Epic-9.md` exists with "Book Related Work" content
   - **Self-Awareness:** Project discovered and reported issue (BR-kanban-installation-issue.md)

2. **Framework Infrastructure Epics (1-8) in Project**
   - **Description:** Epics 1-8 are framework infrastructure epics from ai-dev-kit repo
   - **Impact:** MAJOR - Confusion about project vs. framework work
   - **Root Cause:** Same as above - manual copy instead of installer

3. **Manual Copy Pattern**
   - **Description:** Project manually copied epics instead of using installer
   - **Impact:** MAJOR - Got ai-dev-kit's actual epics instead of canonical templates
   - **Root Cause:** Installer not discoverable, unclear documentation

### 1.6 Recommendations

**For This Project:**
1. **Remove Epic 9** - "Book Related Work" has no relevance to rules project
2. **Evaluate Epics 1-8** - Determine if these are needed or should be removed
3. **Consider Re-installation** - Use `install_kanban_framework.py` to get canonical templates
4. **Clarify Project Boundaries** - Ensure only project-relevant epics remain
5. **Keep Epic 10** - Internationalization is appropriate for multi-IDE project

**For ADK:**
1. **CRITICAL: Make Installer Primary/Only Method**
   - **Current Issue:** Installer not discoverable, manual copy too easy
   - **Fix:** Make `install_kanban_framework.py` the primary/only installation method
   - **Documentation:** Update README to emphasize installer, add warnings about manual copy

2. **Clarify Installation Instructions**
   - Make it CRYSTAL CLEAR that projects should NOT copy ai-dev-kit's own Kanban structure
   - Projects should use Kanban package template, not dev-kit's own epics
   - Add explicit warnings about this mashup

3. **Separate Dev-Kit Structure from Package Template**
   - Clearly distinguish between:
     - `ai-dev-kit/KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/` (dev-kit's own structure)
     - `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/` (package template for projects)
   - Make this distinction obvious in installation guide

4. **Add Installation Validation**
   - Create validator to detect mashup issues
   - Warn if project has inappropriate epics (e.g., Epic 9 in non-book projects)
   - Provide cleanup guidance

5. **Improve Installer Discoverability**
   - Make installer script prominently featured in installation instructions
   - Add warnings if manual copy is attempted
   - Default to installing canonical templates, not copying dev-kit's actual board
