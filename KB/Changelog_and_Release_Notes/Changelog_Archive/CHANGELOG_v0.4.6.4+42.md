# Changelog v0.4.6.4+42

**Release Date:** 2025-12-17 13:28:31 UTC  
**Epic:** Epic 4 (Kanban Framework)  
**Story:** Story 6 (Comprehensive Canonical Epics/Stories/Tasks Template System)  
**Task:** Task 4 (Create task template files for each typical task)  
**Build:** 42

## Summary

Completed comprehensive workflow and cursorrules structure analyses as part of the deep trawl analysis initiative. Created two new granular analysis documents and updated all project reports to reference them.

---

## Changes

### 📊 Analysis Documents Created

#### Workflow Structure Analysis
- **File:** `KB/Analysis/workflow-structure-analysis.md`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive workflow structure analysis across all projects
- **Coverage:**
  - Workflow file naming conventions (YAML files, scripts, embedded)
  - Workflow YAML structure patterns (ADK canonical structure, step definitions)
  - Workflow step patterns (dependencies, configuration, mandatory/blocking)
  - Workflow configuration patterns (`rw-config.yaml`, config loading)
  - Workflow execution patterns (agent-driven, script-based, hybrid)
  - Workflow integration patterns (RW, PVW, Intake Workflow)
  - Workflow step count patterns (10-step, 11-step, 12-step canonical, 13-step, 14-step)
  - Workflow customization patterns (config-driven, YAML customization)
  - Workflow validation patterns (branch safety check, validation steps)
  - Workflow progress tracking patterns (Cursor TODO tracking, state machine)
- **Recommendations:** "Ultimate" canonical workflow structure recommendations

#### Cursorrules Structure Analysis
- **File:** `KB/Analysis/cursorrules-structure-analysis.md`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive `.cursorrules` structure analysis across all projects
- **Coverage:**
  - Cursorrules file naming conventions (`.cursorrules` standard, branch-specific)
  - Cursorrules structure patterns (section organization, section naming)
  - RW trigger section patterns (comprehensive, standard, minimal, custom)
  - PVW trigger section patterns (PVW trigger definitions, integration)
  - Document lifecycle management patterns (lifecycle section, metadata)
  - Git workflow restriction patterns (absolute prohibition, branch isolation)
  - Project-specific rule patterns (code style, testing, documentation)
  - Version schema definition patterns (comprehensive, standard, dual format)
  - Branch mapping patterns (standard mapping, detailed mapping)
  - Progress tracking patterns (TODO tracking, state machine, atomicity)
  - Customization patterns (customization instructions, project-specific)
- **Recommendations:** "Ultimate" canonical cursorrules structure recommendations

### 📝 Project Reports Updated

Updated all 9 project reports to reference the new granular analyses:
- `been-there-adk-analysis.md`
- `fynd-deals-adk-analysis.md`
- `dev-toolkit-adk-analysis.md`
- `agentic-ide-rules-adk-analysis.md`
- `confidentia-adk-analysis.md`
- `starborn-legacy-adk-analysis.md`
- `free-party-promoter-adk-analysis.md`
- `vwmp-adk-analysis.md`
- `qa-kb-adk-analysis.md`

Each report now references all 4 granular analyses:
- Task-level analysis
- Knowledge/documentation structure analysis
- Workflow structure analysis
- Cursorrules structure analysis

---

## Technical Details

### Analysis Methodology

Both analyses follow the same granular approach as the previously created task-level and knowledge/documentation structure analyses:
- **Pattern Extraction:** Identified patterns across all 9 analyzed projects
- **Frequency Analysis:** Documented how often each pattern appears
- **Recommendations:** Provided "ultimate" canonical structure recommendations
- **Cross-Reference:** All analyses are cross-referenced in project reports

### Data Collection

- **Workflow Analysis:** Analyzed workflow YAML files, `rw-config.yaml` files, workflow execution patterns, and `.cursorrules` RW trigger sections across all projects
- **Cursorrules Analysis:** Analyzed `.cursorrules` files, RW trigger sections, PVW trigger sections, document lifecycle sections, and project-specific rules across all projects

---

## Impact

### For ADK Development

These analyses provide the granular data needed to:
- Determine the "ultimate" canonical workflow structure
- Determine the "ultimate" canonical cursorrules structure
- Inform ADK framework hardening decisions
- Support meta-analyses across all project reports

### For Client Projects

These analyses document:
- Real-world workflow patterns and variations
- Real-world cursorrules patterns and variations
- Best practices and anti-patterns
- Customization guidance

## Related Work

- **Epic:** Epic 4 (Kanban Framework)
- **Story:** Story 6 (Comprehensive Canonical Epics/Stories/Tasks Template System)
- **Task:** Task 4 (Create task template files for each typical task)
- **Related Analysis:** Part of comprehensive ADK implementation analysis initiative (E6:S06)

---

## Next Steps

- Use workflow structure analysis to finalize canonical workflow structure in ADK frameworks
- Use cursorrules structure analysis to finalize canonical cursorrules structure in ADK frameworks
- Continue with remaining analysis tasks (package management, feedback mechanism)
