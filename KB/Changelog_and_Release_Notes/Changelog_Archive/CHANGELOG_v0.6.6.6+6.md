**Release Date:** 2025-12-17 23:00:00 UTC

**Type:** 📊 Analysis

---

## DO Phase

### Added

- **Good/Bad Practice Catalog** (`KB/Analysis/meta-analysis-good-bad-practices.md`)
  - Comprehensive catalog of good and bad practices identified across 10 projects
  - Organized by framework dimension (Kanban, KB/documentation, workflows, cursorrules)
  - Includes frequency data, impact assessment, and examples
  - Identifies perfect convergence practices (KB directory naming 100%, E/S/T hierarchy 100%)
  - Documents critical bad practices (Epic mashup 30%, Epic 9 mismatch in source, missing cursorrules in source)
  - Provides prevention strategies and recommendations

- **Pattern/Anti-Pattern Identification** (`KB/Analysis/meta-analysis-patterns-anti-patterns.md`)
  - Identifies recurring patterns (good practices) and anti-patterns (bad practices)
  - Includes frequency data, impact assessment, root cause analysis, and examples
  - Documents perfect patterns (KB directory naming 100%, E/S/T hierarchy 100%)
  - Documents critical anti-patterns (Epic mashup, Epic 9 mismatch, missing cursorrules in source)
  - Provides prevention strategies and recommendations
  - Root cause analysis for Epic mashup (Epic 9 mismatch in ai-dev-kit source)

**Key Sections:**
- Patterns: Perfect KB directory naming, perfect E/S/T hierarchy, full-context task naming, story checklist pattern, document frontmatter pattern, config-driven customization pattern, agent-driven workflow execution pattern, perfect 5-pillar KB structure pattern
- Anti-Patterns: Epic mashup (CRITICAL), Epic 9 mismatch in source (CRITICAL), missing cursorrules in source (CRITICAL), missing RW trigger, missing branch safety check (CRITICAL), hardcoded paths, missing config file, missing document lifecycle management, missing git workflow restrictions, source repository not using own frameworks (CRITICAL)
- Root cause analysis: Epic mashup root cause (Epic 9 mismatch in ai-dev-kit source), low adoption root causes (lack of source dogfooding, insufficient tooling, inadequate documentation, legacy inertia)

## CHECK Phase

### Verification

- ✅ Good/bad practice catalog created and committed
- ✅ Pattern/anti-pattern identification document created and committed
- ✅ Comprehensive synthesis of findings from all meta-analyses
- ✅ Frequency data, impact assessment, root cause analysis included
- ✅ Prevention strategies and recommendations provided
- ✅ Root cause analysis for Epic mashup documented

---

## ACT Phase

### Lessons Learned

- Good/bad practice catalog provides comprehensive reference for framework adoption
- Pattern/anti-pattern identification reveals root causes and prevention strategies
- Epic 9 mismatch in ai-dev-kit source is root cause of Epic mashup issue
- Source repository gaps (missing cursorrules, missing rw-config) undermine framework credibility

### Next Steps

- Create 4 "ultimate" canonical framework design documents (Kanban, KB, workflows, cursorrules)
- Implement critical fixes (Epic 9 mismatch, source repository gaps)
- Begin framework hardening based on findings
