## DO Phase

### Changed

- **Meta-Analysis Executive Summary** (`KB/Analysis/meta-analysis-executive-summary.md`)
  - **MAJOR REWRITE:** Transformed from detailed analysis to decision-focused executive summary
  - **Added:** Proposed "ultimate" canonical Kanban E/S/T structure
    - Epic structure: `Epic-{N}` naming, canonical range (1-23), project-specific range (24+)
    - Story structure: `Story-{NNN}-{description}` naming, 3-digit padding
    - Task structure: `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}` full-context naming, 2-digit padding canonical
    - Template system: 21 epic templates, 62+ story templates, 193+ task templates
  - **Added:** Proposed "ultimate" canonical KB/documentation structure
    - Root directory: `KB/` (100% convergence)
    - 5-pillar organization: Architecture, Changelog, PM, Guides, Documentation
    - Document structure: Required frontmatter, lifecycle metadata
    - Navigation: `README.md` (standard), `_index.md` (Obsidian support)
  - **Added:** Proposed "ultimate" canonical workflow structure
    - File naming: `{workflow-name}-workflow.yaml`
    - 12-step Release Workflow with mandatory branch safety check
    - Config-driven approach: `rw-config.yaml` in project root
    - Agent-driven execution pattern with Cursor TODO tracking
  - **Added:** Proposed "ultimate" canonical cursorrules structure
    - Workflow-first section organization
    - Comprehensive 12-step RW trigger
    - Document lifecycle management section
    - Git workflow restrictions section
  - **Added:** Key Decisions Summary table (decisions to adopt proposed structures)
  - **Added:** Legacy Support decisions table (migration paths)
  - **Removed:** Excessive tactical detail (moved to supporting docs)
  - **Focus:** Decision-oriented, executive-friendly format
  - **References:** Supporting tactical docs for implementation details

- **Task Definition** (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-6/Story-006-adk-implementation-analysis-and-package-management.md`)
  - Updated executive summary requirements to clarify decision-focused format
  - Specified that executive summary must include proposed "ultimate" canonical structures
  - Emphasized that detailed analysis belongs in supporting tactical docs

## CHECK Phase

### Verification

- ✅ Executive summary rewritten to decision-focused format
- ✅ Proposed canonical Kanban structure included
- ✅ Proposed canonical KB/documentation structure included
- ✅ Proposed canonical workflow structure included
- ✅ Proposed canonical cursorrules structure included
- ✅ Key decisions summary tables included
- ✅ Legacy support decisions documented
- ✅ Task definition updated to reflect new requirements
- ✅ Executive-friendly format achieved

---

## ACT Phase

### Lessons Learned

- Executive summaries should be decision-focused, not detailed analysis
- Proposed canonical structures are critical deliverables for framework standardization
- Supporting tactical docs should contain detailed analysis
- Clear separation between executive decisions and implementation details improves usability

### Next Steps

- Review and approve proposed canonical structures
- Create ultimate canonical framework design documents (detailed specifications)
- Implement critical fixes (Epic 9 mismatch, source repository gaps)
- Begin framework hardening based on proposed structures
