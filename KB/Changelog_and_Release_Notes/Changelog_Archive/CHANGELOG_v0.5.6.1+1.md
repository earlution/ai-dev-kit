- ✅ Usage patterns and best practices
- ✅ Complete parser implementation example

### Policy Document Updates

**Documentation Maintenance Policy:**
- ✅ Added `policy_salience` section to front-matter
- ✅ 4 key rules with enforcement and validation hints
- ✅ Decision criteria for documentation updates
- ✅ Triggers and integration points
- ✅ Related policies linked

**Kanban Governance Policy:**
- ✅ Added `policy_salience` section to front-matter
- ✅ 5 key rules covering task-driven work, FR/BR flow, hierarchy, versioning
- ✅ Decision criteria for FR/BR intake
- ✅ Triggers for workflow validation
- ✅ Integration points with release workflow

### Schema Features

**Core Fields:**
- `policy_id` - Unique policy identifier
- `type` - Policy type (governance, technical, process, security, data)
- `domain` - Primary and secondary problem domains
- `audience` - Target roles (agents, developers, maintainers, etc.)
- `applies_to` - Documents, activities, components covered
- `excludes` - Explicit exclusions

**Key Rules:**
- Rule ID, summary, must_level (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
- When rules apply (triggers)
- Enforcement (owner, mechanisms)
- Validation hints for agents

**Decision Support:**
- Decision criteria (question → yes/no actions)
- Triggers (event-driven validation)
- Integration points (workflow/tool integration)
- Related policies (cross-policy linking)

## Related Work

- **Story:** E5:S06 - Policy Documentation Structure
- **Epic:** Epic 5 - Documentation Management and Maintenance
- **Feature Request:** FR-022 - Policy Documents Machine-Readable Salience Section
- **Depends On:** None (independent implementation)
- **Enables:** Agentic policy parsing, automated policy validation, policy-driven decision making

---

## Notes

This implementation establishes the foundation for machine-readable policy documents. The schema is designed to be:
- **Human-readable:** YAML format is easy for humans to read and edit
- **Machine-parseable:** Structured format enables programmatic extraction
- **Extensible:** Schema can be extended for new policy types
- **Maintainable:** Clear guidelines ensure consistency

The initial implementation focuses on two key policies (Documentation Maintenance and Kanban Governance) as proof-of-concept. Additional policies can be updated following the same pattern using the provided template and guides.

Agents can now:
- Quickly lookup policy requirements without reading full documents
- Validate actions against policy rules programmatically
- Make policy-driven decisions using decision criteria
- Understand policy integration points with workflows
