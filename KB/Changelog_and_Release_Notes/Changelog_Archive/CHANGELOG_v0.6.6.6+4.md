- Good Practices (perfect convergence, strong convergence, reference implementations)
- Bad Practices (critical and moderate issues)
- Convergence Patterns (what projects converge on)
- Divergence Patterns (what causes drift)
- Root Causes (Epic mashup root cause analysis)
- Cross-Cutting Insights (impact of ai-dev-kit source gaps)
- Recommendations (immediate, short-term, long-term actions)
