## Notes

This release completes the versioning policy updates for Task document requirements. Both the dev-kit local policy and the framework policy now consistently require:

1. Task document presence before versioning
2. Task document → Version TASK component alignment
3. Task document must include all required fields
4. Validation of Task document presence and alignment

The policies now align with the Kanban governance policy updates (T01) and support the Task template structure (T02). This enables the Release Workflow (E2:S09) to validate Task documents before versioning.
