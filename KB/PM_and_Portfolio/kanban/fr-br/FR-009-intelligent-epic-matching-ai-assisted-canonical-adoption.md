# Feature Request: Intelligent Epic Matching and AI-Assisted Canonical Structure Adoption

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-10  
**Submitted By:** AI Agent (Cursor) acting as user/client for dev-toolkit  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**GitHub Issue:** [#7](https://github.com/earlution/ai-dev-kit/issues/7)

---

## Summary

Implement intelligent epic matching with semantic analysis and AI-assisted task migration to enable users to adopt the canonical Kanban structure while intelligently mapping their existing tasks, preserving organizational quality and leveraging proven best practices.

---

## Description

### What functionality is desired?

The Kanban framework migration process needs intelligent capabilities to:

1. **Semantic Epic Matching:** Analyze epic content (title, description, stories, tasks) to detect semantic matches, partial matches, and duplicates between user epics and canonical epics, not just number conflicts.

2. **AI-Assisted Task Migration:** Intelligently map user tasks to appropriate canonical epics/stories based on content analysis, rather than simply renumbering or preserving original locations.

3. **Intelligent Reference Updating:** Automatically update task ID references in changelogs, documentation, and story files based on intelligent task mapping.

4. **Canonical Structure Adoption (Recommended Default):** Make "Adopt Canonical Structure" the recommended migration mode, leveraging AI intelligence to minimize manual effort while achieving optimal organization.

5. **Dynamic Epic Numbering:** Install canonical epics at the next available epic number after user's last epic (not hardcoded to Epic 24).

### What problem does this solve?

**Current Problem:**
- Migration process only detects number conflicts, not semantic matches
- Users must choose between preserving task IDs (sub-optimal organization) or using canonical structure (manual migration)
- No intelligent task mapping - tasks stay in original epics even if they don't match canonical structure
- Preserving IDs + adding canonical epics creates cognitive drag (two sets of epics, unclear boundaries)

**This Feature Solves:**
- **Organizational Quality:** Users get optimal organization by adopting canonical structure
- **Intelligent Migration:** AI agents handle task mapping, reducing manual effort
- **Best Practices:** Leverages proven canonical structure evolved through real-world use
- **Reference Integrity:** Automatic reference updating where possible
- **User Experience:** Clear migration plan with recommendations and rationale

### What is the use case?

**Primary Use Case:** Alice has an existing Kanban structure with Epic 1: "Tool Management" and wants to adopt ai-dev-kit's canonical structure. The system should:
1. Analyze her Epic 1 and detect it matches Canonical Epic 8: "Codebase Maintenance" (75% semantic match)
2. Intelligently map her tasks to appropriate canonical epics/stories
3. Generate migration plan showing all mappings and rationale
4. Execute migration with automatic reference updating
5. Provide migration report for review

**Additional Use Cases:**
- User has Epic 2: "Workflow Automation" that semantically matches Canonical Epic 2: "Workflow Management Framework" → Merge intelligently
- User has Epic 3: "Versioning & Release" that partially matches multiple canonical epics → Split and map intelligently
- User has epics with same purpose but different names → Detect semantic matches and recommend merging

### Who would benefit from this feature?

- **New projects** adopting ai-dev-kit with existing Kanban structures
- **Existing projects** wanting to standardize on canonical structure
- **AI agents** automating project setup and framework integration
- **The ai-dev-kit project itself** by increasing framework adoption and organizational quality

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] **FR-1:** The framework SHALL analyze epic content (title, description, stories, tasks) for semantic matching
- [ ] **FR-2:** The framework SHALL calculate semantic similarity scores (0-100%) between user epics and canonical epics
- [ ] **FR-3:** The framework SHALL detect semantic matches (same purpose, different names), partial matches (overlapping responsibilities), and multiple matches
- [ ] **FR-4:** The framework SHALL intelligently map user tasks to appropriate canonical epics/stories based on content analysis
- [ ] **FR-5:** The framework SHALL generate migration plans with recommendations and rationale
- [ ] **FR-6:** The framework SHALL support "Adopt Canonical Structure" as the recommended default migration mode
- [ ] **FR-7:** The framework SHALL install canonical epics at the next available epic number (not hardcoded)
- [ ] **FR-8:** The framework SHALL automatically update task ID references in changelogs, docs, and story files
- [ ] **FR-9:** The framework SHALL generate migration reports showing all changes and un-updatable references
- [ ] **FR-10:** The framework SHALL present migration plans to users with clear recommendations and trade-offs

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] **Performance:** Semantic analysis should be efficient for large Kanban structures
- [ ] **Reliability:** Migration process must be robust and prevent data loss
- [ ] **Usability:** Migration plan presentation should be clear and actionable
- [ ] **Intelligence:** Task mapping should be contextually aware and accurate
- [ ] **Transparency:** All recommendations must include rationale

## Notes

This feature request is based on comprehensive design decision analysis and UAT findings. The key insight is that preserving task IDs while adding canonical epics creates sub-optimal organization and cognitive drag. The recommended approach is to adopt canonical structure with AI-assisted intelligent migration.

**Key Design Principles:**
1. Canonical structure has evolved through real-world use and incorporates best practices
2. AI agents can intelligently migrate tasks, minimizing manual effort
3. Optimal organization is more valuable than preserving sub-optimal structure
4. Some renumbering is almost inevitable - better to do it intelligently
