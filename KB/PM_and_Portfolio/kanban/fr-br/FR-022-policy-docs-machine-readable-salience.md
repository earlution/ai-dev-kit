## Summary

Add a standardized, machine-readable "Policy Salience" section to all policy documents that captures key rules, enforcement points, decision criteria, and scope in a structured format. This section enables AI agents to quickly parse and understand policy requirements without reading the entire document, while maintaining full human readability.

---

## Description

### What is the Feature?

A structured metadata section (ideally at the top of policy documents) that provides:

1. **Policy Salience Summary:** Key rules, principles, and enforcement points in machine-readable format
2. **Decision Criteria:** When/how the policy applies, triggers, and conditions
3. **Scope Definition:** What the policy governs, what's in/out of scope
4. **Validation Rules:** What agents should check when enforcing the policy
5. **Related Policies:** Links to dependent or related policies

### What Should Happen vs. What Currently Happens?

**Expected Behavior:**
- Policy documents include a standardized "Policy Salience" section (YAML or structured format)
- Agents can quickly extract key policy information without parsing full document
- Policy salience section is human-readable (YAML format)
- Full policy document remains human-readable below the salience section
- Agents can validate actions against policy salience rules programmatically
- Policy salience section follows a standardized schema/template

**Current Behavior:**
- Policy documents are human-readable but lack structured machine-readable summaries
- Agents must parse entire documents to understand policy requirements
- No standardized format for policy metadata beyond lifecycle front-matter
- Policy rules are embedded in prose, making automated extraction difficult
- Agents rely on pattern matching and semantic search to find policy information

### When Does It Occur?

This feature is needed:
- **Every time an agent needs to understand a policy** - Quick lookup of key rules
- **When agents need to validate actions** - Check against policy rules programmatically
- **When creating new policy documents** - Standardized format ensures consistency
- **When updating policies** - Salience section must be kept in sync with policy content
- **When agents need to make policy-driven decisions** - Clear decision criteria

### Who is Affected?

**Primary Affected:**
- AI agents/assistants that need to understand and enforce policies
- Policy document authors (must include salience section)
- Framework maintainers (must define and maintain salience schema)

**Secondary Affected:**
- Developers reading policies (salience section provides quick reference)
- Policy enforcement tools (can parse structured format)
- Documentation tooling (can generate policy summaries from salience)

---

## Problem / Anti-Pattern

- Agents must read entire policy documents to understand key rules
- No standardized way to extract policy requirements programmatically
- Policy rules are embedded in prose, making automated validation difficult
- Inconsistent policy structure makes agent parsing unreliable
- Agents may miss critical policy requirements when parsing long documents
- Manual policy lookup is slow and error-prone for agents

## Scope Analysis

**Problem Domain:** Policy Documentation, Agentic Workflows, Structured Data  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Documentation (policy documents)
- [x] Framework (policy templates, schemas)
- [x] Agent Tooling (policy parsers, validators)
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [x] Testing (policy salience validation)

**Estimated Complexity:**
- [ ] Simple (1-3 days)
- [x] Medium (1 week)
- [ ] Complex (2+ weeks)
- [ ] Very Complex (1+ month)

---

## Use Cases

**Primary Use Case:**
1. Agent needs to understand Kanban Governance Policy
2. Agent reads policy document
3. Agent extracts Policy Salience section (YAML)
4. Agent quickly understands:
   - Key rules (e.g., "All work MUST be task-driven")
   - Decision criteria (e.g., "FR/BR → Task → Story → Epic flow")
   - Scope (e.g., "Applies to all work streams")
   - Validation rules (e.g., "Check for Task document before proceeding")
5. Agent makes policy-compliant decision without reading full document ✅

**Additional Use Cases:**
- Agent validates action against policy salience rules
- Agent generates policy summary from salience section
- Agent checks policy dependencies (related policies)
- Human reader uses salience section as quick reference

---

---

## Implementation Notes

### Proposed Format

**Option 1: Extended YAML Front-Matter (Recommended)**
```yaml
---
lifecycle: evergreen
ttl_days: null
created_at: 2025-12-12T00:00:00Z
expires_at: null
housekeeping_policy: keep
policy_salience:
  type: governance
  scope:
    applies_to: ["all work streams", "kanban system"]
    excludes: []
  key_rules:
    - rule: "All substantive work MUST be task-driven"
      enforcement: required
      validation: "Check for Task document before proceeding"
    - rule: "FR/BR MUST result in at least one Kanban Task"
      enforcement: required
      validation: "Verify Task document exists for FR/BR"
  decision_criteria:
    - criterion: "FR/BR arrives"
      action: "Check for existing Story"
      next: "If found → create Task, else create Story → Task"
    - criterion: "Work doesn't map to task"
      action: "Update Kanban"
  validation_rules:
    - check: "Task document exists"
      when: "Before starting work"
      error: "Work cannot proceed without Task document"
  related_policies:
    - "versioning-policy.md"
    - "release-workflow-policy.md"
---
```

**Option 2: Separate Policy Salience Section (After Front-Matter)**
```markdown
---
lifecycle: evergreen
...
---

# Policy Salience

```yaml
policy_salience:
  type: governance
  scope: ...
  key_rules: ...
  decision_criteria: ...
  validation_rules: ...
  related_policies: ...
```

---

# [Policy Document Title]
...
```

### Schema Definition

**Policy Salience Schema:**
- `type`: Policy type (governance, technical, process, etc.)
- `scope`: What the policy applies to
- `key_rules`: Array of key rules with enforcement level and validation
- `decision_criteria`: Decision tree or criteria for policy application
- `validation_rules`: What agents should check
- `related_policies`: Links to dependent/related policies

### Implementation Approach

1. **Define Schema:** Create policy salience schema specification
2. **Create Template:** Policy salience template for new documents
3. **Update Existing Policies:** Add salience sections to existing policy documents
4. **Create Parser:** Agent tooling to parse policy salience sections
5. **Documentation:** Guide for creating/maintaining salience sections
6. **Validation:** Ensure salience sections stay in sync with policy content

---

## Rationale

**Why This Matters:**
- **Agent Efficiency:** Agents can quickly understand policies without reading full documents
- **Consistency:** Standardized format ensures consistent policy interpretation
- **Automation:** Enables automated policy validation and enforcement
- **Maintainability:** Salience section provides quick reference for humans too

**Why This Should Be Implemented:**
- Current policy documents are optimized for humans, not agents
- Agents must parse entire documents to find key information
- No standardized way to extract policy requirements programmatically
- Policy-driven agent workflows require structured policy data

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Format Preference:** YAML front-matter extension vs. separate section?
2. **Schema Complexity:** How detailed should the salience section be?
3. **Backward Compatibility:** How to handle existing policies without salience?
4. **Validation:** How to ensure salience stays in sync with policy content?
5. **Tooling:** Should we create a policy salience validator/parser?
