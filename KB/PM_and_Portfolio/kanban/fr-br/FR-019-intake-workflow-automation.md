# Feature Request: Intake Workflow Automation

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-11  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ACCEPTED  

---

## Summary

Create an automated intake workflow in the workflow management package that formalizes and automates the process of "intaking" FR/BR/UXR reports into the Kanban system, including decision flow analysis, story/task creation, dependency wiring, and intake documentation updates.

---

## Description

### What is the Feature?

An automated workflow that handles the complete intake process for FR/BR/UXR reports:

1. **Decision Flow Analysis:**
   - Analyze FR/BR/UXR content to determine appropriate Epic/Story/Task placement
   - Check for existing matching stories/tasks
   - Recommend new story creation vs. task addition
   - Determine epic assignment

2. **Kanban Task Creation:**
   - Create or update Kanban tasks based on intake decision
   - Link tasks to FR/BR/UXR documents
   - Wire dependencies and blockers
   - Cross-reference related work

3. **Intake Documentation:**
   - Update FR/BR/UXR document with intake decision
   - Set intake status (ACCEPTED/PENDING/REJECTED/DEFERRED)
   - Record intake date, assigned epic/story/task
   - Add version marker for intake action
   - Create Kanban links

4. **Workflow Integration:**
   - Integrate with Release Workflow for versioning
   - Support trigger-aware execution (e.g., FR/BR commit triggers)
   - Provide agent execution guide

### What Should Happen vs. What Currently Happens?

**Expected Behavior:**
- Agent runs intake workflow: `intake-workflow --fr FR-019.md`
- Workflow analyzes FR content, determines placement, creates tasks
- FR document automatically updated with intake decision and Kanban links
- Kanban tasks created with proper dependencies and references
- Version marker assigned for intake action
- All cross-references wired automatically

**Current Behavior:**
- Intake is manual: agent reads FR, decides placement, creates tasks manually
- FR document updated manually with intake information
- Dependencies and references wired manually
- Version markers assigned manually
- Error-prone and time-consuming

### When Does It Occur?

This feature is needed:
- **Every time an FR/BR/UXR is submitted** - Should trigger intake workflow
- **When FR/BR/UXR needs to be assigned to Kanban** - Automated decision flow
- **When dependencies need to be wired** - Automatic cross-referencing

### Who is Affected?

**Primary Affected:**
- Developers/agents submitting FR/BR/UXR reports
- Framework maintainers (workflow automation)
- Projects using the framework (intake process standardization)

**Secondary Affected:**
- Release Workflow (intake version markers)
- Kanban system (task creation and wiring)
- Documentation consumers (intake traceability)

---

## Problem / Anti-Pattern

- Intake process is manual and error-prone
- No standardized workflow for FR/BR/UXR → Kanban task conversion
- Dependencies and references wired manually, leading to inconsistencies
- Intake documentation updates are manual and frequently forgotten
- No automated decision flow for Epic/Story/Task placement

---

## Scope Analysis

**Problem Domain:** Workflow Management, Kanban Integration, Process Automation  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Backend/API (workflow execution)
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [x] Documentation (workflow guides, agent execution)
- [x] Testing (workflow validation)
- [x] Other: Workflow framework, Kanban framework

**Estimated Complexity:**
- [ ] Simple (1-3 days)
- [ ] Medium (1 week)
- [x] Complex (2+ weeks)
- [ ] Very Complex (1+ month)

---

## Use Cases

**Primary Use Case:**
1. Developer submits FR-019 via GitHub issue
2. Agent runs intake workflow: `intake-workflow --fr FR-019.md`
3. Workflow analyzes FR content, determines Epic 2, Story 11 placement
4. Workflow creates E2:S11:T00 task
5. Workflow updates FR-019 with intake decision and Kanban links
6. Workflow wires dependencies and cross-references
7. Version marker assigned: `v0.2.11.0+0`

**Additional Use Cases:**
- Trigger-aware intake (FR/BR commit triggers intake workflow)
- Batch intake (multiple FRs processed together)
- Intake validation (check for conflicts, missing dependencies)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** Intake workflow analyzes FR/BR/UXR content for decision flow
- [ ] **AC2:** Workflow determines Epic/Story/Task placement automatically
- [ ] **AC3:** Workflow creates or updates Kanban tasks
- [ ] **AC4:** Workflow updates FR/BR/UXR document with intake decision
- [ ] **AC5:** Workflow wires dependencies and blockers automatically
- [ ] **AC6:** Workflow creates cross-references between related work
- [ ] **AC7:** Workflow assigns version marker for intake action
- [ ] **AC8:** Workflow integrates with Release Workflow
- [ ] **AC9:** Workflow supports trigger-aware execution
- [ ] **AC10:** Agent execution guide provided

---

## Rationale

**Why This Matters:**
- **Automation:** Reduces manual work and errors in intake process
- **Standardization:** Ensures consistent intake documentation and wiring
- **Efficiency:** Speeds up FR/BR/UXR → Kanban task conversion
- **Traceability:** Automatic version markers and cross-references improve traceability

**Why This Should Be Implemented:**
- Current manual intake process is error-prone and time-consuming
- No standardized workflow for intake automation
- Dependencies and references frequently missed or wired incorrectly
- Intake documentation updates often forgotten

---

## Implementation Notes

**Key Considerations:**
1. Intake workflow should leverage E4:S10 (Agentic Task Creation) for task creation
2. Decision flow analysis can use semantic matching (from E4:S08)
3. Integration with trigger-aware RW (E2:S07) for automatic intake on FR/BR commits
4. Workflow should be deterministic where possible, agentic for complex decisions
5. Error handling and recovery guidance critical

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Analyze FR/BR/UXR content
2. Determine Epic/Story/Task placement (decision flow)
3. Create or update Kanban tasks
4. Wire dependencies and blockers
5. Create cross-references
6. Update FR/BR/UXR document with intake decision
7. Assign version marker
8. Integrate with RW if needed
